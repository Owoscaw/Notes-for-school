There are many algorithms that can be performed on graphs in order to produce a path or tables of paths. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the distance from one node to any other node. Floyd's algorithm produces a table of least distances, as well as a route table that shows how to take a route of least distance. These algorithms are [[Least Distance Algorithms|least distance algorithms]].

Both Kruskal and Prim's algorithms produce a [[Graph theory|minimum spanning tree]], both are [[MST algorithms]]. The [[Route inspection algorithm|route inspection algorithm]] finds a route of least weight that traverses every arc at least once and returns to the same node, or two different nodes. [[The planarity algorithm]] is used to determine if a graph can be drawn with no arcs crossing one another. Many of these algortihms are involved in solving the [[Travelling salesman problem|travelling salesman problem]].
