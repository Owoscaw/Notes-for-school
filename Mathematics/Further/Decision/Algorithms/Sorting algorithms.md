A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that takes a list, and sorts it in either ascending or descending order. There are many algorithms that do this, however the two main algorithms are quick sort and bubble sort:

## Bubble sort:

A common task in processing data is to sort it into alphabetical or numerical order. The bubble sort can be performed on an unordered list to make the items in alphabetical or numerical order. A bubble sort can be carried out to make a list in ascending or descending order.

Steps for bubble sort:
\> Compare adjacent items
\> If they are in order, leave them
\> If they are not in order, swap them
\> Repeat until all adjacent items are not swapped in an iteration

## Quick sort:

This method involves splitting the main list into sub lists. A pivot is selected in the centre of the list and items greater than it are placed in one sub list while the ones less than it are placed in another sub list. Pivots are then selected in each sub list and the process repeats.

Steps for quick sort:
\> Choose the midpoint item of the list as a pivot
\> Write down all items that are less than the pivot in a sub list, maintining their order
\> Write down the pivot
\> Write down the remaining items (greater than the pivot) in another sub list
\> Apply steps 1 through 4 to each sub list
\> When all items have been chosen as pivots, the algorithm is complete
