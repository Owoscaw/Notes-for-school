An algorithm is a finite sequence of step-by-step instructions that are carried out in order to solve a problem. They can take the form of written words or flow charts. They are used extensively to solve the [[Travelling salesman problem]] and are a key feature in computer science, see [[Optimisation algorithms]]. Types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, bin packing algorithms, and searching algorithms. All are frequently used in computer science.
