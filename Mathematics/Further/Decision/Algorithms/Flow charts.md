Algorithms can be imlemented as flow charts. In a flow chart, the shape of each box determines what it means, for example a pill shaped box represents the start or the end of an algorithm. Boxes are linked by arrowed lines that indicate where to go to when the box has been completed.

This is what each box means:
\> Pill shaped - start / end
\> Rectangle - instruction
\> Diamond - decision

Trace tables are used to keep track of variables and results from a flow chart. Each column contains a single variable or condition, and each row represents an iteration on the algorithm.
