## Resource Histograms:

A resource histogram is an extension of a Gantt chart in the sense that it provides a graphical representation of what needs to happen when, however now indicates how many workers are required for each activity and when they need to be working. Each worker cannot perform multiple activities at once, and once they have started an activity, they have to finish it. Once a worker finishes an activity, they will start the next one as soon as they can (no breaks).
