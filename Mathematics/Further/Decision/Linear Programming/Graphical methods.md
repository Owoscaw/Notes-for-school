[[Linear programming problems]] with two decision variables can be illustrated graphically on an $x,y$ plane. Areas that satisfy all constraints can be indicated on this plane, once the constraints have been drawn. To solve a problem once it has been drawn, the point that maximises or minimises the objective function needs to be found. There are two solutions for this, the ruler method, and the point test method.

To carry out the ruler method:
\> Set objective function equal to a value, draw a new line
\> Repeat step 1 for many values until a clear point is outlined that will minimise or maximise the function

To carry out the point test method:
\> Find points where inequality lines cross
\> Test each point using the objective function
\> Choose points that minimise or maximise the value of the function

If a question asks for integer solutions, find the closest integer point to the point that maximises or minimises the objective. If need be, test each of these points with all the constraints and the objective function to determine an integer solution.
