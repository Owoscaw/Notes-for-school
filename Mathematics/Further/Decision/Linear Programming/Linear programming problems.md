For any linear programming problems, there exist many definitions of terminology;
\> The decision variables in a linear programming problem are the numbers of each of the things that can be varied
\> Objective function refers to the function that represents the aim of the problem. For example minimise cost, or maximise profit
\> The constraints are what limits the decision variables, they prevent the use of an infinite amount of varuables
\> Values that satisfy all constraints are called a feasible solution
\> The region that contains all feasible solutions is known as the feasible region
\> The optimal solution is the feasible solution that meets the opjective

Linear programming problems are given in the form of written words, and constraints need to be formulated from them through the process of [[Abstraction and automation|abstraction]]. Do to this:
\> Define decision variables ($x, y, z$)
\> State the objective (maximise or minimise)
\> Write constraints as inequalities
