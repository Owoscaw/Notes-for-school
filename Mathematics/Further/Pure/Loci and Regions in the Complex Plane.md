A locus is a set of points that satisfy a given equality, for example the locus of points whose distance from the origin is 3 would represent a circle centred at the origin of radius 3. This extends to the [[Complex numbers|complex plane]] with three main types of loci: circles, perpendicular bisectors, and half-lines.


## Circles:
The distance between two complex numbers can be given by:
$$\Large |z_1-z_2|$$

Using this, the locus of points that have are a given distance away from another point, $z_1$ can be represented by:
$$\Huge |z-z_1|=r$$
Where $z$ is the locus that satisfies this equation, $z_1$ is a complex number, and $r$ is the distance between $z_1$ and evey point in the locus, $z$. The cartesian equivalent of this is a circle of radius $r$ with a centre at $z_1$.


## Perpendicular Bisectors:
Using the same logic is in circles, $|z_1-z_2|$, the perpendicular bisector of two points can be defined by:
$$\Huge |z-z_1|=|z-z_2|$$
This means that the locus of $z$ are the same distance away from $z_1$ as $z_2$. This representation of a perpendicular bisector is much easier to write than in a cartesian system.


## Half-Lines:
Half-lines represent the set of points that have the same argument with respect to a fixed point, $z_1$. They look like lines extending from $z_1$ at a given angle, $\theta$, written as follows:
$$\Huge arg(z-z_1)=\theta$$
