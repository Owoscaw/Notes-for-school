## Definition:

By conventional mathematics, $\sqrt{-1}$ has no answer, Euler popularised the answerr, $i$. This is known as the imaginary unit, and has come to prove useful for many areas of mathematics. An imaginary number is a number that consists of only multiples of $i$, while a complex number has a real and imaginary component. This introduced a new set, the complex numbers;
$$\Huge \mathbb{C}$$
This definition can be used to write any negative square root as a multiple of $i$, for example:
$$\Large \sqrt{-36}=\sqrt{36}\,\times\sqrt{-1}=\pm\,6i$$
A complex number is written as:
$$\Huge z=a+bi\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,a,b\in\mathbb{R}$$
Complex numbers are the roots of a function that never crosses the $x$-axis. For example:
$$\Large x^2+4x+40=(x+2)^2-4+40\,\,\to\,\,(x+2)^2=-36$$
$$\Large x+2=\sqrt{-36}=\pm\,6i\,\,\to\,\,x=-2\,\pm\,6i$$
$$\huge x_1=-2+6i\,\,\,\,\,\,x_2=-2-6i$$
Note that complex solutions to an equation always come in pairs; specifically complex conjugate pairs. This means that if a cubic equation has only one real solution, the other two will be complex conjugate pairs. A polynomial can never have an odd amount of complex solutions:
$$\huge z=a+bi\,\,\,\,\,\,\,z^*=a-bi$$

## Argand diagrams:

An argand diagram is a graphical way of representing a complex number, sometimes known as the complex plane. They are very similar to the cartesian plane, in the sense that the imaginary part of a complex number represents the $y$-coordinate, and the real part represents the $x$-coordinate. In this way, complex numbers can also be thought of as vectors that take a point from the origin, to said point:
