A locus is a set of points that satisfy a given equality, for example the locus of points whose distance from the origin is 3 would represent a circle centred at the origin of radius 3. This extends to the [[Complex numbers|complex plane]] with three main types of loci: circles, perpendicular bisectors, and half-lines.


## Circles:
The distance between two complex numbers can be given by:
$$\Large |z_1-z_2|$$
Seen here:

Using this, the locus of points that have are a given distance away from another point, $z_1$ can be represented by:
$$\Huge |z-z_1|=r$$
Where $z$ is the locus that satisfies this equation, $z_1$ is a complex number, and $r$ is the distance between $z_1$ and evey point in the locus, $z$. The cartesian equivalent of this is a circle of radius $r$ with a centre at $z_1$.


## Perpendicular Bisectors:
Using the same logic is in circles, $|z_1-z_2|$, the perpendicular bisector of two points can be defined by:
$$\Huge |z-z_1|=|z-z_2|$$
This means that the locus of $z$ are the same distance away from $z_1$ as $z_2$. This representation of a perpendicular bisector is much easier to write than in a cartesian system.


## Half-Lines:
Half-lines represent the set of points that have the same argument with respect to a fixed point, $z_1$. They look like lines extending from $z_1$ at a given angle, $\theta$, written as follows:
$$\Huge arg(z-z_1)=\theta$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle at which the half-line meets the real axis, and $z_1$ is the point the half-line extends from.


## Regions:
[[Sets|Set]] notation can be used to represent a region in the complex plane. These are very similar to loci, however feature inequalities instead. Instead of a single point or a line, these regions are an entire area of points that satisfy the inequality. For example:
$$\huge \{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z-z_1|\leq r\}$$
This set represents the points inside a "circle" of radius $r$ and centred at $z_1$. Sets can be combined using regular set operations like $\cup, \cap$ and $\textbackslash$ . For example:
$$\huge \{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z-z_1|\leq r_1\}\cap\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z-z_1|\geq r_2\}$$
This set represents the points between a circle of radius $r_1$ and a circle of radius $r_2$ about a point, $z_1$. If  $r_1 > r_2$ , this set will look like a donut.
