## Modulus argument form:

A [[Complex numbers|complex number]] can also be written as it's modulus, times the cosine of its argument and the $i$sin of its argument:
$$\Large z=|z|\times\left(cos(arg\,z)+i\,sin(arg\,x)\right)$$
Where the modulus of $z$ is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by $z$'s real and complex parts, and the argument of z is the angle it makes with the positive real axis:

For other quadrants, the angle needs to be altered:

## Exponential form:

Using the Maclaurin expansion of $cos\,x$ and $sin\,x$, as well as $e^x$, a complex number can be written in the form:
$$\Huge z=re^{i\theta}$$
Where $r$ is the modulus, and $\theta$ is the argument of $z$. This form of complex number trivialises complex number arithmetic, as exponent rules apply.
