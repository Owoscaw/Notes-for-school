Just as a polynomial of order $n$ will have $n$ distinct roots, a complex number raised to a power $n$ will have $n$ distinct solutions:
$$\Huge z^n=z_1$$
Has $n$ distinct roots. These roots can be found by considering the periodicity of $\sin$ and $\cos$, repeating every $2\pi$ radians:
$$\huge \cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}=\cos{(\theta+2k\pi)}+i\sin{(\theta+2k\pi)}$$
$$\huge e^{i\theta}=e^{i(\theta+2k\pi)}$$
