# Measures of location:

A measure of location is a way of measuring a position within a data set. It is a single value that represents some factor of a data set. If it is representitive of the centre of a data set in any way, it is known as a **measure of central tendancy**. There are three basic measures of central tendancy, mode, median, and mean:
$$\Huge \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$
Where n is the amount of data values in a given set of data, $X$. If $X$ is a frequency table, $\bar{x}$ can be calulated using:
$$\Huge \bar{x}=\frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}$$
Some other measures of location are the quartiles. These are data points where a given percentage of the data is either side of the point. For example, $Q_{1}$ is the first quartile, and is 25% into the data set, $Q_{2}$ is 50% e.c.t.: 
$$\Huge Q_{n}=\frac{n}{4}\sum f\,\,\,th\,\,piece\,\,of\,\,data$$
This can be generalised to percentiles, where $n$ is the percenile of data between 0 and 100:
$$\Huge P_{n}=\frac{n}{100}\sum f\,\,\,th\,\,piece\,\,of\,\,data$$

# Measures of spread:#

A measure of spread is an attribute of a data set that decribes its spread, or how it is distributed. The range of a data set is the difference between its smallest and largest values, and describes the range of data within the set. The IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, $IQR=Q_{3}-Q_{1}$. This can be generalised to the inter-percentile range.

Another measure of spread is known as **variance**. This measure of spread utilises the fact that each data point will deviate from the mean by $x-\bar{x}$:
$$\Huge \sigma^{2}=\frac{\sum x^{2}}{n}-\left(\frac{\sum x}{n}\right)^{2}$$
$$\Huge \sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum x^{2}}{n}-\bar{x^{2}}$$
Standard deviation is the square root of variance. 

**When comparing two data sets, at least one measure of spread should be compared to at least one measure of location.**
