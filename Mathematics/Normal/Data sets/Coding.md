Coding is a method used to simplify a data set. Each data value is changed according to a set of rules, generally in the form:
$$\Huge Y=\frac{X-a}{b}$$
For measures of location and spread, information about the new data set can be found using the formula:
$$\Huge \bar{Y}=\frac{\bar{X}-a}{b}$$
$$\Huge \sigma_{y} = \frac{\sigma_{x}}{b}$$
The mean of a coded data set is subject to every change made to the original data set because it is a measure of location, every numerical change will alter the mean in some way. The standard deviation of a coded data set is only subject to changes that affect how the data set is spread out, in this case a scale factor of $\frac{1}{b}$.
