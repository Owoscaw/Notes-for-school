There are two ways of measuring a population, taking a cencus or a sample. A sample involves observing a subset of the population, the subset is selected based off of a number of criteria or rules. A cencus simply observes the whole population.

### Cencus:
>Completely accurate observation
>Time consuming
>Expensive
>Hard to process

----------------------------

### Sample:

>Less time-consuming
>Easier to process
>Data may be more innaccurate
>Sample size may not be large enough to represent population

---------------

#### Random sampling:

In random sampling, every member of a population has an equal chance to be selected. This removes bias from sampling, and ensures that the sample collected is representitive of the population.

>Bias free
>Easy and cheap for small population and sample size
>Each sampling unit (member of population) has an equal chance to be sampled 
>Unsiutable for large population or sample size
>Sampling frame is needed 

#### Systematic sampling:

In systematic sampling, members of a population are chosen from an ordered list at regular intervals. For example, every 50th person in an alphabetically ordered list is chosen to be observed. The first person from this list should be chosen randomly.

>Simple and quick
>Suitable for large sample sizes and populations
>Sampling frame is needed
>Can introduce bias if sampling frame is not random

#### Stratified sampling:

In stratified sampling, a population is divided into mutually exclusive strata (e.g. tax brackets) and a random sample is taken from each. The amount of people chosen from the random sample in each of the strata is proportional to the size of the strata compared to the population size:
$$\large members\,\,chosen\,\,in\,\,a\,\,stratum=\frac{stratum\,\,size}{population\,\,size}\times sample\,\,size$$
>Sample accurately reflects population structure
>Gaurentees representation from each stratum
>Population must be classified into strata
>Selection within in stratum suffers the same downsides as simple random sampling

#### Non-Random sampling:

There are two types of non-random sampling, Quota and Opportunity. In quota stampling, a sample is selected that represents the whole population. This is where a person is sampled based off of their belonging to a strata, until the researcher has sampled a desired number of population members from each stratum. Opportunity sampling is where members of a population are sampled based off of convienience, e.g. the first person a researcher sees that fits their criteria.

Quota:
>Enables a small sample size to represent a large population
>No sampling frame required
>Quick, easy, and inexpensive
>Allows for easy comparison
>Can introduce bias
>Population must be in stratum

Opportunity:
>Easy and inexpensive
>Unlikely to be representitive
>Highly dependent on the researcher
