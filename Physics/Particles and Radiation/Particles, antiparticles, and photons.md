For every existing particle exists an antiparticle which has the same rest mass but with all other properties opposite. For example, the positron is the antiparticle of the electron, both have the same mass but opposite charge. This is a table of the particles and corresponding antiparticles involved in beta decay:

An antiparticle will have the antiquark equivalent of all of it's corresponding particle's quarks, see [[Quarks and antiquarks]].

Electromagnetic radiation travels in discrete packets called photons, which are responsible for energy transfer and are massless. The energy of a photon is determined by its frequency, according to the following equation:
$$\Huge E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
Where $h$ is Planck's constant, equal to $6.63\times10^{-34}Js$.


Annihilation occurs when a particle, and it's corresponding antiparticle collide. During this process, the combined pass of both the particle and antiparticle are converted into energy according to Einsteins formula, $E=mc^{2}$. This energy is radiated as electromagnetic radiation, in the form of two photos travelling in opposite directions to one another. 

An application of annihilation is in a PET scanner, which allows for the imaging of the internal structure of the body. This is particularly useful in medical fields. PET scanners detect the arrival of oppositely travelling photons and use this to locate and image the source.


Pair production is the opposite of annihilation. This is the process of electromagnetic radiation producing a particle, and it's corresponding antiparticle. Again, this is in accordance to $E=mc^{2}$. Any energy leftover from the production of the particles is given to them in the form of kinetic energy.
