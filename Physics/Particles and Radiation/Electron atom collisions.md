Electrons exist in discrete energy levels within the shells of an atom and can gain energy if another free electron collides with it. This can cause them to move up an energy level, known as an excited state. These electrons can sometimes gain enough energy to be completely removed from the atom. This is known as ionisation., which links to [[The photoelectric effect]].

If an electron is excited, it will return to its original energy level and release the difference in energy as a photon. An example of a practical use for this is in fluorescent tubing. In a fluorescent tube, the applied voltage causes electrons to accelerate through the tube, colliding with electrons in the mercury vapour on their way. This causes a chain of ionisation which eventually reaches the inner coating of the tube. When electrons collide with electrons bound by the atoms of the coating, they are excited and move up an energy level. They then quickly move down to their original energy level, releasing the difference in energy in the form of a photon. These photons travel as visible light.

Differences in energy levels are often very small, so they are described in electron volts ($eV$) instead of joules ($J$). An electron volt is described as the amount of energy gained by one electron when passing through a potential difference of one volt and is equivalent to $1.6\times10^{-19}J$.
