Every fundamental particle has certain properties that must be conserved during interactions. Particles have these characteristics according to their [[Classification of particles|classification]]. The following properties must always be conserved during [[Particle interactions]]:
\> Energy and momentum
\> Charge
\> Baryon number
\> Electron / Muon / Tau lepton number
\> Strangeness (only in strong interactions)

The following interaction and corresponding table show the conservation of different properties:
$$\Huge n\longrightarrow p\,+e^{-}+\bar{v}_{e}$$

Beta minus and beta plus decay are governed by the weak interaction, as a quark changes nature in both of them.
