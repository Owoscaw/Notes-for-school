There exist 4 fundamental forces:
\> gravity
\> electromagnetism
\> weak nuclear
\> strong nuclear

Forces between particles are caused by exchange particles. These particles carry energy, momentum, and information between particles that are experiencing the force. The following table describes each force, including their exchange particle:

The weak nuclear force governs beta decay, electron capture, and all other interactions in which quarks change nature. The following Feynman diagrams show these interactions:

During these interactions, all properties must be conserved. These properties are:
\> Baryon number
\> Respective lepton number
\> Charge
\> Strangeness
These are explored further in [[Applications of conservation laws]]. This also shares links to [[Conservation of energy]].
