There are three types of quarks required by the AQA specification that are characterised as follows:

The antiparticle version of these quarks have opposite signs for all of the above values.

Quarks combine to form baryons and mesons. The quark combination uud forms a proton, as the charges add for a relative charge of +1, $+\frac{2}{3}e+\frac{2}{3}e-\frac{1}{3}e=e$. The same logic applies for the quark structure of an antiproton and a neutron. An antibaryon and antimeson will have the exact same quark structure of their respective particle, however, with every quark being its antiquark counterpart.

The following quark combinations form different mesons:

A neutron will decay into a proton in accordance to the following equation:
$$\Huge n\longrightarrow p\,+e^{-}+\bar{v}_{e}$$
