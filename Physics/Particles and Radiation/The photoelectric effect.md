The photoelectric effect describes the emission of photoelectrons from the surface of a metal when light of certain frequencies are incident on it. Any frequency light over the metal's threshold frequency cause the emission of photoelectrons.

The threshold frequency cannot be explained by the wave theory of light, as it suggests that any frequency of light should be able to cause the emission of photoelectrons over a long enough time period. However, this phenomenon could be explained by thinking of light as a continuous stream of photons. This suggests that:
\> EM waves travel in packets of a discrete amount of energy,, known as photons.
\> Each electron absorbs a single photon - this explains the emission of photoelectrons above, and only above, a certain threshold frequency
\> The amount of photoelectrons emitted per second is proportional in some way to the intensity of incident light

The work function of a metal is the minimum energy required for the emission of photoelectrons and is denoted by $\phi$. The stopping potential is the potential difference needed to be applied across the metal in order to stop the electrons with maximum kinetic energy. Measuring the stopping potential allows for the deduction of the maximum kinetic energy that electrons are emitted with. This can be written as:
$$\Huge E_{k\,(max)}= charge \times voltage =eV_{s}$$
$$\Huge E_{k\,(max)}=hf\,-\phi$$
The energy of incident photons is calculated using $E=hf$ and is explored further in [[Particles, antiparticles, and photons]].
