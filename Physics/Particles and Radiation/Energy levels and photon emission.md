Passing light from a fluorescent tube through a diffraction grating, or a prism, show's it's line spectra. Each line in the spectrum represents a different wavelength of light emittede by the tube. This spectrum is not continuous and only represents discrete values for wavelengths of light. This is evidence to suggest that electrons can only transition between discrete energy levels within an atom.

These results can also be produced by passing white light through a cooled gas to show a line absorption spectrum, which is a continuos spectrum of all possible wavelengths of light with black lines at certain wavelengths. These wavelengths represent the possible differences in energy levels, as atoms in the gas can only absorb energy equal to the exact difference between two energy levels.

The difference between two energy levels is equal to the energy that a specific photon that is emitted. This can be written as:
$$\Huge \Delta E=E_{1}\,-\,E_{2}$$
As $E=hf$ (see [[Particles, antiparticles, and photons]]), it can also be written as;
$$\Huge \Delta E=hf=E_{1}\,-\,E_{2}$$
