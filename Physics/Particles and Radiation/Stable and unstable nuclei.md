The strong nuclear force is a fundamental force that keeps nuclei stable by providing an opposition to the electromagnetic repulsion between protons in the nucleus (like charges repulse). This force only acts on nucleons within a very small range. It is attractive between separations on between 3 and 0.5 fm.

A nucleus becomes unstable when it has too many or too little of either protons or neutrons, the most massive [[Constituents of the atom]]. Too many protons causes the electromagnetic force to overcome the strong nuclear force, too many neutrons causes nucleons to become too close together to the point where the strong nuclear force is repulsive.

Alpha decay occurs in unstable nuclei with too many of both protons and neutrons. An alpha particle of 2 neutrons and 2 protons is emitted from the nucleus:
$$\Huge_{Z}^{A}X\longrightarrow_{Z-2}^{A-4}Y+\,_{2}^{4}\alpha$$
Beta-minus decay occurs in neutron rich nuclei (too many neutrons). A neutron decays into a proton and an electron:
$$\Huge_{Z}^{A}X\longrightarrow_{Z+1}^{A}Y+\,_{-1}^{0}\beta\,+\bar{v_{e}}$$ Where $\bar{v_{e}}$ is an antielectron neutrino. The antielectron neutrino was discovered through energy level observations, as there was seen to be less energy after the decay. This is not possible according to the laws of energy conservation, so a particle was proposed to have been created from this leftover energy and was later observed experimentally.
