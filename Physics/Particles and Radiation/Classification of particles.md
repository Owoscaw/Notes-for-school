All particles fall into two categories, hadrons and leptons. Leptons are fundamental particles, they cannot be broken up further and do not experience the strong nuclear force. Hadrons are made up of quarks, which are fundamental particles. These particles experience the strong nuclear force.

Hadrons can further be categorized as baryons, antibaryons, and mesons. Baryons are particles formed from three quarks, antibaryons are formed from three antiquarks, and mesons are formed from a quark and an antiquark. These particles are summarized in the following diagram:

A baryon has a baryon number of 1, while an antibaryon has a baryon number of -1, and all other particles have a baryon number of 0. The proton is the only stable baryon, all other baryons will eventually decay into a proton.

The lepton number of a particle is 1 if the particle is a lepton, -1 if it is an antilepton, or 0 if it is not a lepton. Note that lepton number is specific to electrons, muons, and tau particles. A muon and a tau particles are heavier versions of electrons, and will eventually decay into them.

Strangeness is a property of particles similar to lepton or baryon number. If a particle contains a single strange quark, it has strangeness of -1. If it contains a single antistrange quark, it has a strangeness of +1, otherwise 0.
