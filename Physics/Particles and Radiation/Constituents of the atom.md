An atom is formed from 3 constituents: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The centre of an atom, the nucleus, contains only protons and neutrons, while the electrons orbit at different energy levels around this nucleus. These constituents have the following properties:
\> Proton: +1 relative charge, +$1.6\times10^{-19}C$ charge, $1.67\times10^{-27}kg$ mass, 1 relative mass
\> Neutron: 0 relative charge, $0\,C$ charge, $1.67\times10^{-27}kg$ mass, 1 relative mass
\> Electron: -1 relative charge, $-1.6\times10^{-19}C$ charge, $9.11\times10^{-31}kg$ mass, 0.0005 relative mass

Protons and neutrons are baryons (see [[Classification of particles]]), whereas the electron is a lepton.

The specific charge of a particle is the ratio between its charge and mass, calculated through: $Specific\,charge=\frac{Charge}{Mass}$ .


The proton number describes the number of protons in an atom, while the nucleon number describes the total number of protons and neutrons, denoted as Z and A respectively. Therefore, an atom of nucleon number A and proton number Z can be represented as:
$$\Huge_{Z}^{A}X$$ 

Isotopes are atoms with the same amount of protons, however a different amount of neutrons. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, commonly used to set a date to a particular organic material. This process is done by calculating the percentage of carbon-14 remaining in the material, as well as the starting amount of carbon-14, to calculate an approximate age.
