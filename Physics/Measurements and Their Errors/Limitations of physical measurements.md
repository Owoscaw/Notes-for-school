Random errors cause readings to differ randomly from a mean. These errors cannot be eliminated, only mitigated. Random errors are mitigated by taking repeat readings and finding a mean, using data loggers and computer equiptment to eliminate human error, or increasing the resolution (smallest reading something can take) of equiptment.

Systematic errors affect accuracy and occur due to faults in equiptment or method. These errors cause results to differ by a constant amount every time. An example of a systematic error would be a zero error (a piece of equiptment that is not zeroed). Systematic error can be eliminated entirely by calibrating equiptment, correcting for background factors, and ensure scales are not being read at an angle (parallax error).

A precise measurement is a measurement that concistently fluctuates around a mean value. An experiment is repeatable if it can be redone and the same results produced. An experiment is reproducable if it can be done with a different person or method and the same results are found. The resolution of a piece of equiptment is the smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives recognisable change in reading. An accurate measurement is one that is close to the true value.

The uncertainty of a measurement defines the bounds in which the true value lies, for example $20^{\circ}C\,\pm\,2^{\circ}C$  means that the true value lies between $18\textendash22^{\circ}C$ .

Absolute uncertainty is given as a fixed quantity above or below a quantity: $7\pm0.6\,V$ 

Fractional uncertainty is given as a fraction of the measurement above or below the measurement: $7\pm\frac{3}{35}\,V$ 

Percentage uncertainty is given as a percentage of the measurement above or below the measuremt: $7\pm8.6\%\,V$ 

Percentage and fractional uncertainties can be reduced by measuring in large quantities

Readings are defined as when one value is found, like reading off of a thermometer. Measurements are defined as when the difference between two readings is found, like when reading off of a ruler. Uncertainty in a reading is $\pm$ half the smallest division, uncertainty in a measurement is at least $\pm$ 1 the smallest division. Digital readings and given values will either have the uncertainty quoted, or will have an uncertainty of the last significant digit. For example off of a voltmeter: $3.2\pm0.1\,V$.

For repeated data, the uncertainty is half of the range. This is expressed as $mean\pm\frac{range}{2}$ . Uncertainties should be given to the same number of significant figures as the data.


Uncertainties are often combined in equations, they follow the rules as follow:
\> Adding/subtracting data: Add absolute uncertainties
\> Multiplying/dividing data: Add percentage uncertainties
\> Raising data to a power: Multiply percentage uncertainty by the power

The uncertainty in a gradient of a graph can be given by $\frac{|best\,gradient - worst\,gradient|}{best gradient}\times100\%$ 

This is the same for any point plotted on the graph.
