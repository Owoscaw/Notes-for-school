Units in physics can be described as non fundamental or fundamental. Non-fundamental units can be brokem down into smaller units until they are only composed of fundamental units. These fundamental units are known as SI units and are defined as follows:
\> Mass (m): kg (kilograms)
\> Length (l): m (metres)
\> Time (t): s (seconds)
\> Amount of substance (n): mol (moles)
\> Temperature (t): K (kelvin)
\> Electric current (I): A (amperes)

A quantity in terms of SI units can be derived from their equation. For example, SI units for force can be found from it's equation F=ma. Mass is measured in $kg$ and acceleration is measured in $ms^{-2}$ so multiplying these two SI units together gives $kgms^{-2}$ which is directly equivalent to the newton.

Another example is voltage:
$V=\frac{E}{Q}$ 

$E=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
$E=kg(ms^{-1})^{2}$
$E=kg\,m^{2}s^{-2}$

$Q=It$
$Q=As$

$V=\frac{kg\,m^{2}s^{-2}}{As}$
$V=kg\,m^{2}s^{-3}A^{-1}$

Prefixes can also be added to any SI unit as shorthand for a multiplier, for example Tera (T) could be added before Hertz ($s^{-1}$) to infer the unit $s^{-1}\times10^{12}$.  A prefix describes the [[Orders of magnitude|order of magnitude]] that a unit belongs to. These prefixes are as follows:
