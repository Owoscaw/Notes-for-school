A simple harmonic system is a system in which a body exhibits [[Simple harmonic motion]]. The two main examples of simple harmonic systems are the mass spring system, and the simple pendulum.

## Simple pendulum:

In a simple pendulum, a bob of mass $m$ is hung from a string of length $l$ from a fixed point, and is allowed to oscillate between angles of $\pm10\,deg$ . The restriction on angle is because the small angle approximation needs to be used for the associated formula to hold:
$$\Huge T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$
## Mass-Spring system:

In a mass spring system, a mass of mass $m$ is attatched to a spring of spring constant $k$. The mass, when let go, will oscillate in simple harmonic motion due to the effect of the constant force from the spring, towards equlilbrium:
$$\Huge T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
## Energy stores:

For any simple harmonic system, kinetic and potential energy trade off with one another as the system enacts its cycle. At the maximum displacement of a system, its amplitude, potential energy is at maximum. When the system passes through its equilibrium, kinetic energy is at its maximum:

## Damping:

Damping causes energy losses from a simple harmonic system to the surrounding environment. This causes reduced amplitude over time, as more and more energy is lost to surroundings. There are three main types of damping:

> Light damping, where amplitude is decreased gradually by a relatively small amount per oscillation.
> Critical daming, where amplitude is to be reduced in the shortest possible amount of time, ideally within 0 oscillations
> Heavy damping, where amplitude is reduced at a slower rate than critical damping, however still stops any oscillations from happening
