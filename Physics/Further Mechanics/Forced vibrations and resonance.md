Free vibrations occur in a [[Simple harmonic systems|simple harmonic system]] when no external force is causing oscillation, allowing for the system to oscillate at its natural frequency. Forced vibrations occur when a system experiences a driving force from an outside source, which causes oscillations. The system will oscillate at the driving force's frequency. As the frequency of the driving forces approaches the system's natural (resonant) frequency, amplitude will drastically increase:

Resonance can be beneficial in many circumstances, like when pushing a child on a swing or in radio antennae. However it can also cause significant damage to structures unintentionally. Damping can often solve this issue, as increasing dampening will have the following effects:

>Lower resonant frequency
>Decreased maximum amplitude
>Maximum amplitude peak is spread

This can be shown in the following graph, where $\zeta$ represents the degree of dampening:
