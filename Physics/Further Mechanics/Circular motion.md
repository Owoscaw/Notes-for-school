When a body is in circular motion around a fixed point with radius, $r$, it will experience an angular velocity around the centre of rotation. While this body is in circular motion, it can be said to have an angular velocity. This angular velocity describes how fast around the point the body is moving, and is given by:
$$\Huge \omega = 2\pi f = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi T\,^{-1}$$
The unit for $\omega$ is radians per second, as $2\pi$ is measured in radians, and $T$ is measured in seconds, so raising $T$ to the $-1$th power and multiplying by a unit measured in radians will result in angular velocity having a unit of radians per second, $\theta^{\,c}s^{-1}$. 

At any given moment, the body will have a linear velocity tangential to it's circular path.
