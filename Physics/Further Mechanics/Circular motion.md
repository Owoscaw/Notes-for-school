When a body is in circular motion around a fixed point with radius, $r$, it will experience an angular velocity around the centre of rotation. While this body is in circular motion, it can be said to have an angular velocity. This angular velocity describes how fast around the point the body is moving, and is given by:
$$\huge \omega =\frac{\theta}{t}=\frac{v}{r}=2\pi f = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi T\,^{-1}$$
The unit for $\omega$ is radians per second, as $2\pi$ is measured in radians, and $T$ is measured in seconds, so raising $T$ to the $-1$th power and multiplying by a unit measured in radians will result in angular velocity having a unit of radians per second, $\theta^{\,c}s^{-1}$. 

At any given moment, the body will have a linear velocity tangential to its circular path. This velocity will be constantly changing, as the tangent is constantly changing. As velocity is constantly changing, the body is constantly accelerating or decelerating. Since there is an acceleration on a body, it must be experiencing a force. This force is known as the centripetal force. The linear velocity of a body in circular motion can be found via the following steps:

$$\Huge v=\frac{s}{t}=\frac{\theta r}{t}=\frac{\theta}{t}\times r=\omega r$$
Centripetal acceleration can be found by considering linear velocity at two different angles:

By considering the triangle formed by placing the vectors that represent linear velocity together, and the triangle formed by OAB:

Since these triangles are both isoceles (considering small changes in velocity), and share an angle, they are congruent. Therefore, the ratios between their sides can be considered equivalent:
$$\huge \frac{\Delta v}{v}=\frac{v\Delta t}{r}$$
Solving for $\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$:
$$\huge \frac{\Delta v}{v\Delta t}=\frac{v}{r}$$
$$\huge a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}\times\frac{r}{r}=\frac{v^{2}}{r^{2}}\times r=\omega r$$
