A body is in simple harmonic motion when its acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from equilibrium and acts in the opposite direction to motion. There is a constant force towards the equilibirum, known as the restoring force:
$$\Huge a=-\omega^{2}x$$
Where $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.

A simple pendulum is an example of an object in simple harmonic motion. The mass on the end of the pendulum experiences a constant force acting towards the center of the pendulum, the equlibirium:

Here, $A$ is the maxmimum displacemant from equilibrium, and $x$ is displacement from equlilibrium. It follows that the position of the body in simple harmonic motion follows the equation:
$$\Huge x=A\cos(\omega t)$$
$$\Huge v=-\,\omega A\sin(\omega t)$$
$$\Huge a=-\omega^{2}A\cos(\omega t)$$
It follows that:
$$\Huge x_{max}=A$$
$$\Huge v_{max}=\omega A$$
$$\Huge a_{max}=\omega^{2}A$$
Another equation used for velocity in a simple harmonic motion system is:
$$\Huge v=\pm\sqrt{(A^{2}-x^{2})}$$
