Superposition is when the displacement of two waves combine as they pass each other to produce a resultant displacement equal to the algebraic sum of each wave's displacement. Two types of interference can happen in superposition:
\> Constructive interference, when two waves have displacement in the same direction
\> Desctructive interference, when one of the waves has displacement in the direction opposite to the other. When two waves have equal but opposite displacement, complete destructive interference occurs and the waves completely cancel eachother out.

# Stationary waves:

A stationary wave is formed by the superposition of two progressive waves, travelling in opposite directions in the same plane, at the same speed, with the same frequency, same wavelength, and the same amplitude. No energy is transferred in a stationary wave. When the waves meet in phase, constructive interference occurs and antinodes are formed (regions of maximum amplitude). When the waves meet completely out of phase, complete destructive interference occurs and nodes are formed (regions of no displacement). A stationary wave is the opposite of a [[Progressive waves|progressive wave]].

A string fixed at one end, and to a driving oscillator at the other, forms a stationary wave. The wave travelling down the string from the oscillator is reflected at the fixed end of the string and travels back along the string, causing superposition of the two waves. Because both of these waves have the same wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, a stationary wave forms:

# Harmonics

The lowest frequency at which a stationary wave can form is known as the first harmonic, and subsiquenct frequencies are known as the nth harmonics. In the first harmonic, two nodes and a single antinode are formed. The distance between two adjacent nodes / antinodes is half of a wavelength for any harmonic. This frequency is calculated using the following formula:
$$\Huge f=\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
Where $L$ is the length of the string, $T$ is the tension in the string, and $\mu$ is the mass of the string per unit length.

The second harmonic will be twice the frequency of the first harmonic:
$$\Huge F_{n}=nF_{1}$$
Where $F_{1}$ is the first harmonic.

The first 5 harmonics can be visualised:

Stationary microwaves can be formed by reflecting a microwave beam at a metal plate, this is why food is always cold in the middle.

Stationary sound waves can be formed by placing a speaker at one end of a closed glass tube, with powder placed throughout the tube. This powder will be shaken by the sound waves to settle at the nodes. The distance between piles of powder will be half the wavelength of the sound wave.
