A progressive wave transfers energy without transferring material and is made up of particles of a medium (or field) oscillating. For example, the electrical and magnetic fields of a wave oscillate to produce an EM wave. 

Both [[Longitudinal and transverse waves]] have the following characteristics:
\> Amplitude: A wave's maximum displacement from its equilibrium
\> Frequency: The number of full oscillations that pass through a point per second
\> Wavelength: The length of one whole oscillation
\> Speed: Distance travelled by the wave per second
\> Phase: the position of a certain point on a wave cycle
\> Phase difference: How much a particle or point lags behind another particle or point
\> Period: Time taken for one full oscillation

Two points can be described as in phase if they are both at the same point of the wave cycle. They will have the same displacement and velocity.

Two points are out of phase when they are an odd integer of half cycles apart: 
$$\Huge Phase_{1}\,-Phase_{2}=\frac{n\pi}{2}$$

The speed of a wave is equal to its frequency times its wavelength:
$$\Huge c=\lambda f$$ The frequency of a wave is equal to 1 over its period:
$$\Huge f=\frac{1}{T}$$
