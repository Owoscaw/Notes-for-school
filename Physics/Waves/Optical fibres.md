A useful application of [[Refraction, diffraction, and interference|total internal reflection]] is in optical fibres. These are flexible, thin tubes of plastic and glass that carry information in the form of light signals. They have opitcally dense cores surrounded by cladding with a lower optical density. This creates the perfect conditions for total internal reflection, allowing rays of light to travel all the way through the cable without signal degradation from parts of the signal refracting into the cladding.

Signal degradation can however be caused by:
\> Absorption, where part of the signal's energy is absorbed by the fibre, reducing the amplitude of the signal
\> Dispersion. This causes pulse broadening, where the recieved signal is broader than the original transmitted signal. Modal dispersion is caused by rays of light entering the fibre at different angles, therefore taking different paths through the fibre. As the different rays travel different distances, they will exit the fibre over a wider range of time than they entered. Material dispersion is caused by using light of different wavelengths, meaning light rays will travel at different speeds along the fibre.
