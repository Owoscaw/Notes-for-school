A transverse wave is classified as any wave where the oscillation of particles or fields are at right angles to the direction of energy transfer. Longitudinal waves are characterised as waves where the oscillation of particles or fields are parallel to the direction of energy transfer. These waves feature compressions and rarefactions and cannot travel in a vaccum, they need a medium.

A polarised wave oscillates in only one plane, only transverse waves can be polarised. Polarisation provides evidence for the nature of transverse waves because polaraisation can only occur if a wave's oscillations are perpendicular to its direction of travel.

Polariod sunglasses are an application of polarisation. They reduce glare by blocking partially polarised light that is reflected by water and tarmac.

Another application for polarisation is TV and radio signals, which use plane polarised antenna to favour the reception of waves that oscillate in a specific plane. This is often used to pick up only groundwave signals. An antenna must be aligned in the same plane of oscillation in order for it to recieve the signal in its full clarity.
