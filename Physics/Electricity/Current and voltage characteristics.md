Ohms law dictates that for an ohmic conductor, current is directly proprtional to the potential difference accross it, given that all physical conditions remain constant.

An ohmic conductor has an I-V graph that looks like this:

The gradient of an I-V graph will be $\frac{dI}{dV}$, or in other words, resistance. The resistance of a material and therefore component is determined by its [[Resistivity]].

A semiconductor diode has a bias towards current flowing in a given direction. The forward bias of a diode is the direction in which current can flow easily past the threshold voltage (the voltage needed for current to easily flow). In the directoin of reverse bias, the resistance of the diode is very high.

A filament lamp contains a length of wire that heats up as current increases. As it heats up, the atoms within it will vibrate at a higher amplitude and therefore interfere with flowing current to a greater degree. This produces the effect of higher resistance as more current flows across it. At lower currents, the lamp does not heat up to a significant degree for this to come into play. Ohms law is obeyed until this point is reached.

Ammeters can be assumed to have zero resistance, as to not affect the measurement of current. Voltmeters can be assumed to have infinite resistance, meaning no current can flow accross them. This means that both pieces of equiptment will show the exact value.
