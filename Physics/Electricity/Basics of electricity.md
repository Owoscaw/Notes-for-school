Electrical current ($I$) is defined as the flow of charge per unit time, the rate of flow of charge. It is derived from the equation:
$$\Huge I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$
Where $Q$ is charge.

Potential difference ($V$) is defined as the energy transferred per unit charge between two points in a circuit. It is derived from the equation:
$$\Huge V=\frac{W}{Q}$$
Where $W$ is energy transferred.

Resistance ($R$) is a measure of the difficulty that charge carriers face when passing through an electrical component and is dervied from this equation:
$$\Huge R=\frac{V}{I}$$

Electric circuits represent the arrangement of components and how they link together. The configuration of a circuit determines how current and charge flow. This is determined in [[Circuits]].
