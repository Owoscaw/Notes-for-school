Resistivity ($\rho$) is a measure of how easily a material conducts electricty. It is defines as the product of resistance and cross-sectional area, divided by the length of the material. Resistivity will give the value of resistance through a material of length 1Â $m$ and cross-sectional area of 1 $m^{2}$. Resistivity is dependent on environmental factors, such as temperatures. 
$$\Huge \rho =\frac{RA}{L}$$
Where R is resistance, A is cross-sectional area, and L is length of material.

When the temperature of a metallic conductor increases, its resistance will increase. This is because the atoms within the metal will vibrate at a greater amplitude due to the added thermal energy. Charge carriers will collide with the atoms more frequently, slowing them down to a greater degree.

The opposite is true for thermistors. As the temperature of the thermistor increases, more charge carriers are freed from the binding of their atom and become availible to carry charge. This is because they gain the energy given to the thermistor in the form of thermal energy.

Thermistors are particularly useful for temperature sensors, which can trigger an electrical signal when temperature crosses a certain value. For example, they could be used in an oven to keep it at a certain temperature.

A superconductor is a material which, below a certain temperature, known as the critical temperature, has zero resistivity. The critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the material it is made out of, typically close to 0 kelvin. Resistivity suddenly drops to zero below this critical temperature. This makes them extermely useful for magnetic field technology like maglev trains as well as power cables, as no energy is lost due to resistance.
