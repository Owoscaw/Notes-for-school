Two rules apply when calculating resistance in a circuit:
\> In series: $R_{T}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+\dots+R_{N}$ 
\> In parallel: $\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\dots+\frac{1}{R_{N}}$ 

Both of these rules may need to be used to calculate the total resistance of a circuit if a there is a parallel component in series or a series component in parallel.

Power ($P$) is the energy transferred over time, $P=\frac{E}{t}$, where $E$ is energy transferred. Another formula for power is $P=VI$, which can be combined with Ohm's law to produce:
$$\Huge P=VI=\frac{V^{2}}{R}=I^{2}R$$
As power is defined as energy transferred over time, the product of power and time is the total energy transferred, therefore:
$$\Huge P=\frac{E}{t}\,\,\,\,\longrightarrow E=Pt=VIt$$
In a series circuit, current is the same everywhere in the circuit and the p.d. supplied by the battery is shared across all components in the circuit according to their resistance.

In a parallel circuit, the sum of the currents in each parallel set of branches is equal to the total current drawn, and the potential difference accross each branch is the same.

When battery cells are joined in series, the total voltage adds up:
$$\Huge V_{T}=V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}+\dots+V_{N}$$
When identical battery cells are joined in parallel, the total voltage is equal to the voltage of one cell. This is because current is split equally between branches, therefore the overall potential diffrence is the same as if the current were flowing through a single cell:
$$\Huge V_{T}=V_{1}=V_{2}=V_{3}=\dots=V_{N}$$
In DC (Direct Current) circuits, charge and energy are always conserved according to Kirchoff's laws:
\> The total current flowing into a junction is equal to the total current flowing out of that junction
\> The sum of all voltages in a series circuit is equal to the battery's voltage
