A potential divider is a [[Circuits|circuit]] with several resistors in series connected across a voltage source, used to produce a required fraction of the source's potential difference across two particular points in the circuit. This can be made a variable amount by adding a variable resistor.

A temperature or light sensor can also be made out of a similar configuration, but with a thermistor or light dependent resistor respectively. These can be used to trigger certain events, for example when a certain temperature is achieved, the resistance of a thermistor will decrease, providing a higher proportion of the battery's voltage across two particular "output" points.
