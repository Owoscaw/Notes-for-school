Batteries have an internal resistance ($r$) which is caused by the collision of electrons with atoms inside the battery, causing a small amount of energy loss before the electrons leave hte battery. This can be represented as a small resistor inside a battery. Internal resistance often causes additional [[Limitations of physical measurements|uncertainty]] within a circuit.

Electromotive force ($\varepsilon$) is the energy transferred by a cell per coulomb of charge that passes through it:
$$\Huge \varepsilon =\frac{E}{Q}$$
In a circuit, internal resistance can be represented through this equation:
$$\Huge R_{T}=R+r$$

Therefore emf (electromotive force) is the product of the total resistance of the circuit:
$$\Huge \varepsilon=IR_{T}$$
$$\Huge \varepsilon=I(R+r)$$
$$\Huge \varepsilon=V+Ir$$
The p.d. across the resistor R, is known as the terminal p.d., whereas the p.d. across the resistor r is known as the lost volts, because it is equal to the energy lost by the baterry per coloumb charge. The emf of a battery can be measured by measuring the voltage across a cell using a voltmeter when there is no current running through said cell (open circuit).
