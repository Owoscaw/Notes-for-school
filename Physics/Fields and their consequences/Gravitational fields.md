Gravity acts on any objects with mass and is always attractive. It has infinite range, however diminishes proportionally to the inverse square law.

Newton's law of gravitation dictates that the force between two masses is proportional to the product of their masses, $m_1$, $m_2$, divided by the distance between then, $r$, squared:
$$\Huge F\propto\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
$$\Huge F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
Where $G$ is the gravitational constant.

## Graviational field strength:

There are two types of gravitational field, uniform and radial. In a uniform gravitational field, graviational attraction is constant throughout the field and acts in the same direction. In a radial gravitational field, gravitational attraction is dependent on the seperation between two objects, as the strength of a radial gravitational field diminishes as seperation from the source increases.

Gravitational field strengh, $g$, is the force per unit mass exeterted by a gravitational field on an object. This value is constant in a uniform field, but varies in a radial field. This is also a property of the field, it is not dependent on the mass of the object in the field.
Uniform:
$$\Huge g=\frac{F}{m}$$
Radial:
$$\Huge g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$

## Graviational Potential:

Gravitational potential, $V$, at a point in a field is the work done per unit mass as a result from moving an object from infinity to the point. At infinity, gravitational potential is zero. When an object is released from infinity to a point, energy is released as GPE is reduced. For an arbitrary point at distance $r$ from the source in a radial field:
$$\Large V=-\int_r^\infty\frac{GM}{x^2}\,dx=-GM\left(\lim_{t\to\infty}\int_r^tx^{-2}dx\right)$$
$$\large V=-GM\left(\lim_{t\to\infty}\left[-\frac{1}{x}\right]^t_r\right)=-GM\left(\lim_{t\to\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{t}+\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)$$
$$\Large V=-GM\left(0\,+\,\frac{1}{r}\right)=-\frac{GM}{r}$$
$$\Huge V=-\frac{GM}{r}$$
The gravitational potential difference, $\Delta V$, is the energy needed to move a unit mass between two points. Work done moving a mass, $m$ through potential $\Delta V$ is equivalent to:
$$\Huge E=m\,\Delta V$$

Gravitational field strength at any point is the derivative of gravitational potiential, i.e:
$$\Large \frac{d}{dr}\left(V\right)=g=\frac{d}{dr}\left(-\frac{GM}{r}\right)=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$
Therefore, gravitational potential is the area under a curve representing gravitational field strength, all with respect to distance from the mass, $M$.

## Equipotential:

Equipotential surfaces are created by joining points of equal potential in a gravitational field together. Gravitational potential on an equipotential surface is constant everywhere. No work is done when moving along an equipotential surface.
