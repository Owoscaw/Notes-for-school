Coulomb's law dictates that the force between two point charges in a vacuum is directly proportional to the product of their charges, and inversley proportional to the square of the distance between the charges, i.e:
$$\Large F\propto\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2},\,\,\,F=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $k$ is a constant given by:
$$\Large F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the magnitudes of each charge, $r$ is the distance between them, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittibity of free space.

If the charge on $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are like, the force between them will be repulsive. Wheraes if it were opposite, the force would be attractive.

## Subatomic particles:

The magnitude of the charges on subatomic particles is much larger than their rest mass, meaning that the electrostatic force affects subatomic particles significantly more than the gravitational force.

## Electric field strength:

Electric field strength, similar to [[Gravitational fields|gravitational field strength]], is defined as the force experienced by an electric field per unit charge. This is constant in a uniform field, but varies in a radial field:
$$\Large Parallel: \,\,E=\frac{F}{Q},\,\,\,E=\frac{V}{d}$$
$$\Large Radial:\,\,E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}$$
Where $E$ is the strength (at a point) of an electric field, $F$ is the force experienced per unit mass, $Q$ is the charge of the object causing the electric field, $V$ is potential difference across parallel plates, $d$ is distance between parallel plates, and $r$ is the distance between charges.

The radial formula is found by using the original formula for the force between two point charges, and taking one of them to be $1$, i.e. force per unit charge.
