Coulomb's law dictates that the force between two point charges in a vacuum is directly proportional to the product of their charges, and inversley proportional to the square of the distance between the charges, i.e:
$$\Large F\propto\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2},\,\,\,F=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $k$ is a constant given by:
$$\Large F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the magnitudes of each charge, $r$ is the distance between them, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittibity of free space.

If the charge on $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are like, the force between them will be repulsive. Wheraes if it were opposite, the force would be attractive.

## Subatomic particles:

The magnitude of the charges on subatomic particles is much larger than their rest mass, meaning that the electrostatic force affects subatomic particles significantly more than the gravitational force.

## Electric field strength:

Electric field strength, similar to [[Gravitational fields|gravitational field strength]], is defined as the force experienced by an electric field per unit charge. This is constant in a uniform field, but varies in a radial field:
$$\Large Parallel: \,\,E=\frac{F}{Q},\,\,\,E=\frac{V}{d}$$
$$\Large Radial:\,\,E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}$$
Where $E$ is the strength (at a point) of an electric field, $F$ is the force experienced per unit mass, $Q$ is the charge of the object causing the electric field, $V$ is potential difference across parallel plates, $d$ is distance between parallel plates, and $r$ is the distance between charges.

The radial formula is found by using the original formula for the force between two point charges, and taking one of them to be $1$, i.e. force per unit charge. The sign of field strength depends on the sign of the charge, if it is positive then the field strength is positive, if it is negative then the field strength is negative.

When moving a charge between parallel plates, Work done is the product of force and distance:
$$\huge Work\,done=Fd=(EQ)d=EQ\left(\frac{\Delta V}{E}\right)$$
$$\Huge Work\,done=Q\Delta V$$
When a charge is fired into a uniform electric field between two parallel plates, there will be a constant force perpendicular to the charge's initial motion, so it will move in a parabolic shape.

## Electric potential:

Electric potential, $V$, at a point is defined as the potential energy per positive unit charge at that point in a field. Potential is greatest at the centre of the field, and zero at infinity. This can be found using the following integral:
$$\Large V=\int_r^\infty E\,dx=\int_r^\infty \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{x^2}dx=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\lim_{t\to\infty}\int_r^tx^{-2}dx$$
$$\Large V=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\lim_{t\to\infty}\left[-\frac{1}{x}\right]_r^t=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\lim_{t\to\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{t}+\frac{1}{r}\right)=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$$
$$\Huge V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r}$$
Where:
\> $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space
\> $Q$ is the magnitude of the charge causing the field
\> $r$ is the distance between the point and the centre of the field

The gradient of radius against potential is the same as electric field strength, i.e.:
$$\Huge E=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta r}$$

## Equipotential:

Similar to [[Gravitational fields|gravitational equipotentials]], Electric fields can have equipotential surfaces. On such surfaces, electric potential due to a field remains constant. Therefore if a charge is moved along an equipotential, no work is done against the electric field it is in.
