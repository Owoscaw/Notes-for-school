Coulomb's law dictates that the force between two point charges in a vacuum is directly proportional to the product of their charges, and inversley proportional to the square of the distance between the charges, i.e:
$$\Large F\propto\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2},\,\,\,F=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $k$ is a constant given by:
$$\Large F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the magnitudes of each charge, $r$ is the distance between them, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittibity of free space.

If the charge on $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are like, the force between them will be repulsive. Wheraes if it were opposite, the force would be attractive.

## Subatomic particles:

The magnitude of the charges on subatomic particles is much larger than their rest mass, meaning that the electrostatic force affects subatomic particles significantly more than the gravitational force.
