In a bar magnet, magnetic field lines flow from north to south.

When current passes theough a wire, a magnetic field is induced in concentric rings around the wire. The field lines flow anti-clockwise when looking down the wire in the direction current is flowing.

# Magnetic flux density:

The magnetic flux density of a mgnetic fiels measures the strength of the field, measured in Tesla. One Tesla is defined as the magnetic flux density that causes a force of 1N on a wire 1m long, carrying 1A of current.

When a wire carrying current is placed in a magnetic field, a force is exerted on the wire. This field has to be perpendicular to the flow of current, otherwise there is no force. Given that this condition is met, the force on the wire is given by:
$$\Huge F=BIl$$
Where $B$ is magnetic flux density in Tesla, $I$ is the current flowing through the wire, and $l$ is the length of wire inside the magnetic field. The force that is felt by the wire is perpendicular to both the direction of the field and the direction in which current is flowing. The direction of the force can be found by aligning the middle finger with the direction of current flow, aligning the index finger with the direction in which the magnetic field flows, and fully extending the thumb.
