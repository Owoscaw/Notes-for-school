# Perpendicular case:

Magnetic flux describes the magnetic field that passes through a determined area, calculated by the product of magnetic flux density and the magnitude of the given area. When the field is perpendicular to the area:
$$\Huge \phi=BA$$
Where $\phi$ is magnetic flux, $B$ is magnetic flux density, and $A$ is the given area.

Magnetic flux linkage is the product of magnetic flux and the number of turns on a coil:
$$\Huge \Phi=N\phi=BAN$$

# Angled case:

If a coil is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, the component of the magnetic field that acts perpendiclarly needs to be resolved:

The magnitude of magnetic flux and magnetic flux linkage in this case is given by:
$$\Huge \phi=BA\,cos\,\theta$$
$$\Huge \Phi=N\phi=BAN\,cos\,\theta$$
