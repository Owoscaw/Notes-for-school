Transformers are used with [[Alternating Current|alternating currents]] to change the size of their voltage. They consist of a primary coil, connected to the input voltage, and a secondary coil, connected to the output voltage. An iron core links both coils in a hollowed square shape. The primary coil [[Electromagnetic Induction|induces]] an alternating magnetic field that travels through the core and induces a voltage in the secondary coil:

Faraday's Law can be used to deduce that the ratio of the voltage in the primary coil to the seconday coil is equal to the ratio of their turns. The primary coil induces a certain change in flux linkage in a certain amount of time. This will be equal on both coils:
$$\huge V_p=N_p\frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t},\,\,\,V_s=N_s\frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}$$
$$\huge \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}=\frac{V_p}{N_p}=\frac{V_s}{N_s}$$
$$\huge V_pN_s=V_sN_p,\,\,\,\frac{N_s}{N_p}=\frac{V_s}{V_p}$$
