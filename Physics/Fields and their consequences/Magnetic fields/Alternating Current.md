When a coil rotates through a magnetic field, an [[Electromagnetic Induction|emf is induced]]. This is given by $\epsilon =BAN\omega\,sin(\omega t)$, which contains the sine function. The sine function alternates between positive and negative, so any current induced through this method will be alternating.

# Oscilloscopes:

An oscilloscope can show any type of current, and how it varies over time. Direct current is shown as a line parallel to the $x$ axis, when the time base is turned off it appears as a single point on the axis. Alternating current is shown as a sine wave, when the time base is turned off it appears as a line along the $y$ axis that shows the range of values it can take:

The scale of both axis can be adjusted. The $y$ axis represents voltage and the $x$ axis represents time.

There are many useful readings that can be taken from an alternating current:
> Peak voltage, $V_0$, the distance from equilibrium to the highest or lowest voltage
> Peak-to-peak voltage, the difference between extrema
> RMS voltage, the average of all possible voltages squared and square rooted

$$\Huge I_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{(I_0)^2}{2}}=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$$
$$\Huge V_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{(V_0)^2}{2}}=\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}$$
Where $_0$ denotes the peak value for each measurement.
