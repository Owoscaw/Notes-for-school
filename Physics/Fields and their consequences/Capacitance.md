A capacitor is an electrical component that can store charge if a potential difference is applied over it. The capacitance of a capacitor is defined by how much charge can be stored per unit potential difference applied, i.e.:
$$\Large Capacitance, C=\frac{Charge, Q}{Potential\,difference, V}$$
$$\Huge C=\frac{Q}{V}$$

## Parallel plate capacitors:

A parallel plate capacitor is formed by two conducting plates seperated by an insulating material (dielectric). A [[Electric Fields|uniform electric field]] is formed between the plates
