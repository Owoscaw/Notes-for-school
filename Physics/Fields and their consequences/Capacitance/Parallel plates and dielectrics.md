A capacitor is an electrical component that can store charge if a potential difference is applied over it. The capacitance of a capacitor is defined by how much charge can be stored per unit potential difference applied, i.e.:
$$\Large Capacitance, C=\frac{Charge, Q}{Potential\,difference, V}$$
$$\Huge C=\frac{Q}{V}$$

## Parallel plate capacitors:

A parallel plate capacitor is formed by two conducting plates seperated by an insulating material (dielectric). A [[Electric Fields|uniform electric field]] is formed between the plates. The dielectric insulating material has a property known as permittivity, $\epsilon$. Permittivity is a measure of a materials' ability to store an electric field. Relative permittivity is known as a material's dielectric constant:
$$\Huge \epsilon_r=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}$$
Where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The capacitance of any given parallel plate can be calculated by:
$$\Huge C=\frac{A\,\epsilon_0\,\epsilon_r}{d}$$
Where $C$ is the capacitance of the parallel plate capacitor, $A$ is the intersecting area of the plates, and $d$ is the distance between them:

# Dielectrics:

A dielectric material consists of polar molecules, where each end of any molecule is oppositely charged. When these molecules are in their normal state, they are aligned randomly and there is no net field formed by their alignment.

When an electric field runs through the dielectric material, the polar molecules will align themselves with the field. The negative poles of each material align themselves towards the positive plate of the capacitor, and vice versa. Each polar molecule has an electricl field generate due to its charged poles, the strength of each depends on the dielectric's permittivity:

Each field formed by each aligned polar molecules opposes the field formed by the parallel plates, reducing the net electric field between the plates. As this electric field has now been reduced in strength, it becomes easier to push charge onto the capacitor. This has the effect of decreasing the potential difference required to charge the capacitor fully, increasing capacitance.

# Energy stored:

The energy stored by a capacitor can be found by finding the area under the graph of charge against potential difference:
$$\Huge Q=CV$$
$$\Large E=\int Q\,dV=\int CV\,dV=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$
