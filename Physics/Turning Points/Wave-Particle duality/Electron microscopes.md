A microscope has an attribute, called its resolving power, that defines its ablility to distinguish structures. The wavelength of electron beams are much smaller than that of light (practically), meaning that electron beams can fit between the gaps between very small objects. This allows electron microscopes to have a much higher resolving power than traditional, light-based microscopes. Therefore, electron microscopes are used to view incredibly small structures. The two main types of electron microscope are the Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the Scanning tunnelling microscope (STM):


## Transmission electron microscope:

Transmission electron microscopes use an electron microscope that fires an electron beam through a set of magnetic lenses before passing through an extremely thin sample. All lenses deflect stray electrons from the edges of the lense so that they reach the sample.

These are the three lenses involved:
> Condenser lens - the first lense in the stack that deflects electrons to form a wide parallel beam, directed at the sample
> Objective lens - forms an image of the sample, directly above it
> Projector lens - magnifies the image made by the objective lens before projecting it onto a fluorescent screen below

If the accelerating voltage is increased, the speed of the electrons increases, decreasing the wavelength of the electron beam produced. This relies on the [[de Broglie hypothesis]]. Decreased wavelength increases resolving power, however this is limited by:
> Sample thickness - electrons slow down as they pass through a sample, increasing wavelength and therefore decreasing resolving power
> Range of electron speeds - the electron beam used is produced using an electron gun, and therefore uses thermionic emission. Some electrons can lose kinetic energy while leaving the filament, causing different wavelengths. This can blur the image.


## Scanning tunnelling microscope:

A scanning tunnelling microscope uses the quantum tunnelling effect of electrons in order to form an image of the surface of the sample. Quantum tunnelling occurs due to the wave nature of electrons, allowing them to pass over a physical or potential barrier if it is small enough. The smaller the barrier, the more likely it is that electrons can tunnel.

An STM involves a very fine tipped probe passing over the surface of a sample. This probe stays at a constant potential difference, which prevents electrons from flowing in a different direction. The movement of electrons between the sample and the tip can be measured, known as the tunnelling current. As the probe of the tip moves across the surface, the gap between the probe and the surface will change. When the tip moves away from the surface, tunnelling current will decrease. This is because electrons are less likely to tunnel. When the tip moves closer to the surface, tunnelling current will increase. An STM can operate in two different ways, constant height and constant current.

#### Constant height:
The probe is kept at a constant height, and the tunnelling current is recorded to map out the sample.

#### Constant current:
The tunnelling current is constantly monitored and fed back to the microscope, allowing it to adjust the height of the probe to ensure that the current remains constant. The movement of the probe is then used to map out the sample:
