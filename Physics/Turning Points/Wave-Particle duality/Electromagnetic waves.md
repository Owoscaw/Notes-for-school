Electromagnetic waves are formed by the electric and magnetic fields oscillating in phase, perpendicular to one another:

## Maxwell:
Maxwell predicted the existance of EM waves and theorised a formula for their speed, $c$:
$$\Huge c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}}$$
Where:
>$c$ is the speed of light in a vaccum
>$\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space
>$\epsilon_0$ is the permeativity of free space

$\mu_0$ relates the magnetic flux density produced by a wire to the current in said wire, $\epsilon_0$ relates the electric field strength to charge.

## Hertz:
Hertz discovered radio waves using a spark gap transmitter. This was a device that enables high voltage sparks to jump across a short gap of air. Sparks were produced by a loop of wire with a gap and were measured by a dipole reciever.

A dipole reciever detects a wave's electric field by measuring the alternating current induced. This current is induced by the oscillation of the electric field of an EM wave. If this electric field is oscillating in the same plane as the dipole is oriented, the electric field will push and pull electrons to each end of the dipole, causing electronic flow. This electron flow is detected as alternating current at the same frequency of the EM wave.

The loop of wire detects the alternating magnetic field of the wave. When the magnetic field of the wave enters the loop, magnetic flux changes, therefore inducing a potential difference that causes a spark to cross the gap in the transmitter.

Hertz placed a metal sheet in front of the above apparatus, causing the reflection of the radio wave, creating [[Principle of superposition and stationary waves|stationary waves]]. By using a detector, the distance between adjacent nodes in the stationary wave could be measured. This was used to determine the wavelength of EM waves, which could be combined with the known frequency of the waves to find the overall speed of the waves. This was shown to be consistent with Maxwell's prediction.

## Fizeau:
Fizeau was French and measured the speed of light using the following method:

A beam of light is shone through a gap in a toothed wheel rotating at a slow speed. The beam reflects on a mirror a large, known distance away. When the beam returns, it hits the back of the wheel or through the same gap between teeth it originally went through. The speed of rotation of the wheel is steadily increased until the beam of light can no longer be seen at all, because it is blocked by the tooth in the wheel adjacent to the original gap. The time taken for the light to travel to the mirror and back could therefore be calculated:

For a wheel with $n$ teeth, and therefore $n$ gaps, a tooth will replace a gap every $\frac{1}{2n}$ of a revolution. The time period for one complete revolution is given by $T=\frac{1}{f}$, therefore a tooth will replace a gap every $\frac{1}{2nf}$ seconds:
$$speed=\frac{distance}{time}\,\,\to\,\,c=\frac{2d}{\left(\frac{1}{2nf}\right)}=4dnf$$
Where:
>$c$ is the speed of light
>$d$ is the distance light travelled, i.e. the distance between the wheel and the mirror
>$f$ is the frequency at which the wheel was turning

The result for $c$ determined by Fizeau was extremely close to Maxwell's prediction, providing strong evidence that light was an EM wave.
