A black body is a body that absorbs and emits all possible wavelengths of radiation. Wave theory predicted that with decreasing wavelength, intensity would increase. This led to the prediction that an infinite amount of ultraviolet radiation would be emitted from a black body, unsupported by experimental evidence. The wave theory at the time could not explain experimental results, leading to the "ultraviolet catastrophe". This theory could not explain experimental measurements. The below graph shows intensity against wavelength for black body emission:

## Max Planck:

Max Planck's interpretation of EM waves resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe. Under his interpretation, light travelled in discrete packets called [[Energy levels and photon emission|quanta]], with energy proportional to frequency:
$$\Huge E=hf$$
[[The photoelectric effect]] could not be explained by wave theory because:
> Wave theory suggests that any frequency of light should be able to cause photoelectric emission, as energy absorbed by an electron will accrue over time with each incoming wave. The existance of a threshold frequency could not be explained
> The photoelectric effect happens instantly, which contradicts wave theory in the sense that time is needed to transfer energy to an electron to surpass the work function
> Increasing intensity of light does not increase the speed of photoelectrons emitted, instead the number of photoelectrons emitted per second is increased
> Photoelectrons are released with a range of kinetic energy

## Einstein:

Einstein explanded on Max Planck's work by suggested that EM waves are released in discrete packets, which he called photons. He suggested that these packets have particle-like interactions. This model explained all of the above points, which wave theory could not:
> When a photon interacts with an electron, all of its energy is transferred. An electron can only interact with a single photon. If this energy is above the metal's work function, the electron will be emitted
> Energy from the photon is immediately transferred upon interaction
> Intensity of radiation is equal to the number of photoelectrons emitted per second. When intensity increases, more photons interact with electrons, causing more interactions
> All electrons recieve the same amount of energy, however will take different paths to escape the metal. Along this path, the electron may collide, losing some kinetic energy

If a potential difference is applied across a metal surface to make it positive, the kinetic energy of photoelectrons will decrease. This is because they have to work against the electrostatic force of attraction towards the surface. As this potential difference increases, the number of photoelectrons emitted will decrease until none are emitted. This is because the number of photoelectrons with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the work function, and the electrostatic force, will decrease.

The stopping potential is the potential difference applied to completely stop photoelectrons, even with maximum kinetic energy:
$$\Huge E_{k(max)}=eV_s$$
$$\Large E=hf=\Phi + E_{k(max)}=\Phi\,+eV_s$$
$$\Large eV_s=hf-\Phi\,\,\to\,\,V_s=\frac{h}{e}f-\frac{\Phi}{e}$$
Therefore, graphing stopping potential against frequency will produce a straight line graph with gradient $\frac{h}{e}$, a $y$-intercept of $-\frac{\Phi}{e}$, and an $x$-intercept that represents the threshold frequency of the metal:
