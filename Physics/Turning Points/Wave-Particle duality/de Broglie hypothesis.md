The de Broglie hypothesis states that all particles have a wave-like nature and a particle-like nature, and that the wavelength of any particle relates to its momentum. This uses results from [[The photoelectric effect|photoelectricity]]:
$$\Huge E=hf\,\,,\,E=mc^2\,\,\to\,\,hf=mc^2=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
As de Broglie beleived that all particles share the same nature, he substituted $c$ for the velocity of the particle:
$$\Huge mv^2=\frac{hv}{\lambda}\,\,\to\,\,\lambda=\frac{hv}{mv^2}=\frac{h}{mv}$$

## Electron diffraction:

Electron diffraction provided experimental evidence for the de Broglie hypothesis, as it shows that a particle can undergo diffraction. This was done using an electron gun, vaccuum tube, and a crystal lattice. Here, electrons diffracted through the gaps between atoms to produce a diffraction pattern:

In this experiment, the electron gun accelerates particles to a kinetic energy of $eV$. Combining this information with the de broglie hypothesis:
$$\Large eV=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\,\,\to\,\,m^2v^2=2meV=(mv)^2\,\,\to\,\,mv=\sqrt{2meV}$$
$$\Huge \lambda=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2m_eeV}}$$
This was further proven by increasing the potential difference through which the electrons are accelerated, and observing that the wavelength of electrons decreased. This was observed through the decrease in fringe spacing in the diffraction pattern, see [[Refraction, diffraction, and interference|Young's double slit experiment]].
