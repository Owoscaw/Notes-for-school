When a potential difference is applied across a dishcharge tube (cathode and anode in a tube with low pressure gas), the tube will beging to glow. This glow became known as the cathode ray. Thomson showed that cathode rays have:
> mass
> negative charge
> consistent properties across gasses
> high specific charge
![[cathode ray.png|300]]
> High pd across tube pulls electrons out of the gas atoms, forming ion-electron pairs
> Positive gas ions accelerate towards cathode (negative) and collide, releasing more electrons
> Electrons accelerate towards anode (positive). Low pressure gas allows them to accelerate to high speeds
> Electrons collide with gas atoms on way to anode, causing excitation then de-excitation (releasing photons)

The glow is most intense at the cathode because here, gas ions and electrons recombine, causing the emission of photons.

## Thermionic emission:

This is the process of electron emission due to the heating of a metal. When a high current is passed over a filament, said filament becomes heated. This thermal energy is transferred to electrons, which can gain enough energy to overcome the filament's work function, causing them to be emitted. 

Electron guns use thermionic emmission at the cathode and a high potential difference to "fire" electrons towards the anode. The anode has a small gap, through which electrons pass and form a narrow electron beam. The beam travels beyond the anode at a constant velocity, as there is now no significant force due to the electromagnetic field. The work done on a charged particle due to the electric field is given by:
$$\Huge \Delta W=Q\Delta V$$
Substituting in the charge of an electron, $e$, for charge, and the potential difference applied, $V$, gives:
$$\Huge \Delta W=eV$$

## Specific charge of an electron:

There are two main ways used to determine the specific charge on an electron, the fine beam tube method, and Thomson's crossed fields method.

#### Fine beam tube:
Electrons are accelerated using an electron gun, entering the fine beam tube in a direction perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field that runs across the experiment. The magnetic force on the electrons acts perpendicular to their path, causing them to rotate about a point. In this sense, the magnetic force acts as the centripetal force. The apparatus is set up as follows:

The electrons move through the tube, colliding with gas atoms and causing excitation / de-excitation. This reveals the path of the electron, allowing the radius of their path to be measured. The following steps show how to deduce the electron's specific charge from here:
$$\large F_{c}=F_{m}\,\,\to\,\,\frac{m_{e}\,v^{2}}{r}=Bev\,\,\to\frac{m_{e}v}{r}=Be$$
$$\large E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=eV\,\,\to\,\,v=\sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m_{e}}}$$
$$\large \frac{m_e\sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m_e}}}{r}=Be\,\,\to\,\,\frac{m_{e}^{2}\left(\frac{2eV}{m_e}\right)}{r^2}=B^{2}e^{2}\,\,\to\,\,\frac{2m_{e}V}{r^2}=B^{2}e$$
$$\Large e=\frac{2m_{e}V}{r^{2}B^{2}}\,\,\to\,\,\frac{e}{m_e}=\frac{2V}{B^2r^2}$$
Where:
>$\frac{e}{m_e}$is the specific charge of an electron
>$V$ is the potential difference applied
>$B$ is the magnetic flux density
>$r$ is the radius of the electron's motion

#### Thomson's crossed fields:

This method of determining specific charge involves firing a beam of electrons, using an electron gun, onto a fluorescent screen with the magnetic and electric fields running perpendicular to each other:
![[crossed fields.png|500]]

Electrons are accelerated by the electron gun and enter the apparatus perpendicular to both electric and magnetic field. The magnetic field deflects the electron beam downwards, while the electric field deflects it upwards. The strengths of each field are adjusted until the electron beam travels straight through the apparatus. This allows the electric force to be equated to the magnetic force:
$$\large F_m=F_e\,\,\to\,\,F_m=Bev\,\,,\,F_e=Ee=\frac{Ve}{d}\,\,\to\,\,Bev=\frac{Ve}{d}$$
$$\large v=\frac{Ve}{Be\,d}=\frac{V}{Bd}\,\,\to\,\,E_k=eV_a=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\,\,,\,v^2=\frac{2eV_a}{m_e}$$
$$\large v^2=\frac{V^2}{B^2d^2}=\frac{2eV_a}{m_e}\,\,,\,\frac{e}{m_e}=\frac{V^2}{B^2d^2}\div2V_a{}$$
$$\Huge \frac{e}{m_e}=\frac{V^2}{2B^2d^2V_a}$$
Where:
>$\frac{e}{m_e}$ is the specific charge of an electron
>$V$ is the pd applied to the electric field
>$B$ is the magnetic flux density of the magnetic field
>$d$ is the distance between the two charged plates
>$V_a$ is the pd applied at the electron gun, to accelerate the beam

All of the above variables can be measured in the experiment, allowing Thomson to solve for the specific charge of the electron. This experiment showed that specific charge was constant no matter the gas used to produce electrons, demonstrating that they are in every atom. Thomson went on to propse the plum pudding model of the atom.
