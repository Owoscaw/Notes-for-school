## Newton's corpuscular theory of light:

Newton theorised that light consisted of tiny particles, that he called corpuscues with the following properties:
> Reflection - corpuscules collide with a surface, and a repulsive force pushes them back. This would reverse the corpuscle's vertical component of velocity, while preserving its horizontal component
> Refraction - while a corpuscule approaches a denser medium, a short range force causes the vertical component to increase. This would change the ratio between the vertical and the horizontal component, thus changing the angle through which the corpuscule travels

The only phenomenon that Newton's theory could not describe was diffraction, which led to the creation of Huygen's wave theory.

## Huygen's wave theory of light:

Huygen beleived that light was a wave, and that every point on a wavefront acts as a source for secondary wavelets, that spread out to form the next wavefront. This is known as Huygen's principle:

Using this principle, reflection and refraction were easily explained:

#### Reflection:
As the wave is travelling at an angle, the wavefront will reach the surface over a range of time. Through Huygen's principle, wavelets spread away from the surface upon colliding with it, then rejoin with the other wavelets to form the new reflected wavefront.

#### Refraction:
