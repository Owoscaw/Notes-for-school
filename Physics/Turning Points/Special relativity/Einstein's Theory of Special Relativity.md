Intertial frames of reference are those which move with a constant velocity relative to each other, an accelerating or rotating frame of reference cannot be intertial.

Einstein's theory of special relativity only applies to intertial frames of reference and is based on the following postulates:
> The speed of light is invariant in free space
> The laws of physics have the same form in all interial frames of reference


## Time dilation:

Time dilation is a result of special relativity, it only occurs in inertial frames of refence. It causes time to slow down or speed up relative to an observer.

To an external observer, a stationary observer (as well as the interial frame of reference in which they exist) is moving. The amount of time that passes according to the stationary observer is proper time, $t_0$. Time passed to an external observer, $t$, is calculated by:
$$\Huge t=\frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
Where $v$ is the velocity at which the stationary observer is travelling.

Proper time is always smaller than the time measured by an external observer, as the $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$ term will always be less than or equal to 1.

## Muon decay experiments:

Muon decay provides experimental evidence for time dilation. Muons enter the atmosphere at speeds at which time dilation plays a significant role. This affects the amount of time that passes relative to the muon, and therefore how many decays it will experience before it strikes the surface of the Earth.

Two detectors are needed in order to carry out this experiment. One at a higher altitude than that other, so that a change in muon count rate. The distance between detectors, and velocity of the muons, must also be known.

The expected count rate at the second detector can be found by dividing the distance between detectors by the measured velocity of the muon. This is how much time the muons experience, if special relativaty were not taken into account. The amount of half lives, and therefore expected muon count rate, can be calculated.

Using the same calculation as before, observed time can be found. This is used with the velocity of the muons, relative to the detectors (stationary observers) to find the proper time of the muons. This is how much time was actually experienced by the muons, determining the amount of muon decays that actually happen. The amount of muons at the second detector can be measured, allowing for experimental evidence that supports Einstein's theory.

## Length contraction:

Length contraction is a phenomenon that occurs due to special relativity, causing the length of an object moving at a high speed relative to a stationary observer to shorten in length.

Proper length, $l_0$ is the length measured by an observer at rest, relative to the object:
$$\Huge l=l_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$
Where $l$ is the length of the object, and $v$ is the velocity at which the object travels. Length contraction only occurs about the direction in which the object is moving, i.e. width will not change.

Muon decay also provides evidence for length contraction, as the distance they travel can appear shorted than the distance viewed by a stationary observer.


## Mass and Energy:

In Einstein's theory of special relativity, mass and energy are interchangable through the equation:
$$\Huge E=mc^2$$
Transferring energy to an object causes it's mass to increase. Therefore, the faster an object travels, the more massive it will become. This is called relativistic mass, $m$:
$$\Huge m=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
Where $v$ is the velocity at which the mass travels, and $m_0$ is rest mass.

At speeds above $1/10$ the speed of light, the formula $E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ no longer applies, as the mass of the object begins to change significantly. Substituing $m$ for relativistic mass in $E=mc^2$, the total energy of an object according to special relativity can be expressed:
$$\Huge E=\frac{m_0\,c^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
Since total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy, $E_T=E_k+E_0$ , this formula can be rearranged to find kinetic energy:
$$\huge E_k=\frac{m_0\,c^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}-m_0\,c^2$$
This allows kinetic energy to be calculated at speeds up to $c$, under special relativity.

## Bertozzi's experiment:

Bertozzi provided experimental evidence for the increase in mass of an object approaching the speed of light. It involves a particle accelerator that can emit electrons at varying kinetic energies, two detectors, an oscilloscop, an alluminium plate, and a temperature sensor.

Electrons are released in pulses, and the time taken for them to travel between detectors is measured using the oscilloscope by observing the distance between the peaks. The distance between detectors is measured and the speed of electrons fired can be calculated. The electrons then hit an aluminium plate, where they collide and transfer their kinetic energy in order to heat up the plate. Change in temperature is measured, allowing for the calculation of energy transferred by electrons:
$$\Large E_{one\,electron}=\frac{mc\Delta\theta}{n}$$Where $m$ is the mass of aluminium plate, $c$ is its specific heat capacity, $\Delta\theta$ is change in measured temperature, and $n$ is the number of electrons fired in the pulse.

Bertozzi plotted kinetic energy against speed, and found that values are very close to those predicted by Einstein's theory of Special relativity.
