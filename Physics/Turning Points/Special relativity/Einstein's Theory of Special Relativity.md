Intertial frames of reference are those which move with a constant velocity relative to each other, an accelerating or rotating frame of reference cannot be intertial.

Einstein's theory of special relativity only applies to intertial frames of reference and is based on the following postulates:
> The speed of light is invariant in free space
> The laws of physics have the same form in all interial frames of reference


## Time dilation:

Time dilation is a result of special relativity, it only occurs in inertial frames of refence. It causes time to slow down or speed up relative to an observer.

To an external observer, a stationary observer (as well as the interial frame of reference in which they exist) is moving. The amount of time that passes according to the stationary observer is proper time, $t_0$. Time passed to an external observer, $t$, is calculated by:
$$\Huge t=\frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
Where $v$ is the velocity at which the stationary observer is travelling.

Proper time is always smaller than the time measured by an external observer, as the $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$ term will always be less than or equal to 1.

## Muon decay experiments:

Muon decay provides experimental evidence for time dilation. Muons enter the atmosphere at speeds at which time dilation plays a significant role. This affects the amount of time that passes relative to the muon, and therefore how many decays it will experience before it strikes the surface of the Earth.

Two detectors are needed in order to carry out this experiment. One at a higher altitude than that other, so that a change in muon count rate. The distance between detectors, and velocity of the muons, must also be known.

The expected count rate at the second detector can be found by dividing the distance between detectors by the measured velocity of the muon. This is how much time the muons experience, if special relativaty were not taken into account. The amount of half lives, and therefore expected muon count rate, can be calculated.

Using the same calculation as before, observed time can be found. This is used with the velocity of the muons, relative to the detectors (stationary observers) to find the proper time of the muons. This is how much time was actually experienced by the muons, determining the amount of muon decays that actually happen. The amount of muons at the second detector can be measured, allowing for experimental evidence that supports Einstein's theory.
