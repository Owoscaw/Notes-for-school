## Newton's corpuscular theory of light:

Newton theorised that light consisted of tiny particles, that he called corpuscues with the following properties:
> Reflection - corpuscules collide with a surface, and a repulsive force pushes them back. This would reverse the corpuscle's vertical component of velocity, while preserving its horizontal component
> Refraction - while a corpuscule approaches a denser medium, a short range force causes the vertical component to increase. This would change the ratio between the vertical and the horizontal component, thus changing the angle through which the corpuscule travels

The only phenomenon that Newton's theory could not describe was diffraction, which led to the creation of Huygen's wave theory.

## Huygen's wave theory of light:

Huygen beleived that light was a wave, and that every point on a wavefront acts as a source for secondary wavelets, that spread out to form the next wavefront. This is known as Huygen's principle:

Using this principle, reflection and refraction were easily explained:

#### Reflection:
As the wave is travelling at an angle, the wavefront will reach the surface over a range of time. Through Huygen's principle, wavelets spread away from the surface upon colliding with it, then rejoin with the other wavelets to form the new reflected wavefront:

#### Refraction:
As the wave collides with the surface at an angle, each intersection between the surface and wavefront causes a wavelet to start spreading out. This happens all along the wavefront until the ray of light is fully emerged in the substance. From here, the wavelets join up again and form a wavefront at a different angle than before:

Newton's theory was accepted at the time due to his reputation, and the fact that the speed of light had not yet been measured. When the speed of light was observed to slow down in a denser medium, Newton's corpuscular theory was disproved.

## Young's slits:

[[Refraction, diffraction, and interference|Young's double slit experiment]] disproved Newton's theory of light. This was because according to Newton's theory, the pattern seen would just be two bright fringes, where the corpuscules shone through the slits and collided with the screen. Youngs' double slit experiment proved that light can experience diffraction as well as interference, both could not happen under Newton's theory.
