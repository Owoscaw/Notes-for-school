Millikan determined the charge on an electron using his oil droplet experiment. This involved spraying thousands of tiny oil droplets using an atomizer. These droplets become negatively charged due to friction, then fall onto two parallel plates with a uniform electric field between them. As these droplets are charged, the electric field exerts a force on them. The strength of the electric field can be adjusted by varying the potential difference between the two plates until the droplet is stationary:
$$\Large F_e=F_g\,\,,\,EQ=mg=\frac{QV}{d}$$
However, the mass of the droplet is unkown. This has to be found using Stoke's law, when a spherical object falls under gravity though a fluid:
$$\huge F=6\pi\eta rv$$
Where:
>$F$ is the force exerted due to drag
>$\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid
>$r$ is the radius of the droplet
>$v$ is the droplet's terminal velocity

Solving for radius gives:
$$\large 6\pi\eta \,rv=mg=\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi \,r^3\rho\right)g\,\,\to\,\,6\eta \,v=\frac{4}{3}r^2\rho g\,\,\to\,\,r^2=\frac{9\eta \,v}{2\rho g}$$
Where:
>$\rho$ is the density of the oil droplet
>$r$ is the radius of the droplet
>$\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid (air)

Using the formula equating the force exerted by the electric field, and the above formula, we can solve for the charge on an electron, $Q$:
$$\large \frac{QV}{d}=mg=\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi \,r^3\right)\rho g=\frac{4}{3}\pi \,r\left(\frac{9\eta \,v}{2\rho g}\right)\rho g=\frac{36}{6}\pi\,r\eta \,v$$
$$\Large Q=6\pi \,r\eta\,v\,\,\div\,\,\frac{V}{d}=e=\frac{6\pi\,r\eta\,vd}{V}$$
$$\Huge e=\frac{6\pi\,r\eta\,vd}{V}$$
Where:
>$r$ is the radius of the droplet, calculated above
>$\eta$ is the viscosity of air
>$v$ is the droplet's terminal velocity
>$d$ is the distance between the two charged plates
>$V$ is the pd applied between the charged plates
