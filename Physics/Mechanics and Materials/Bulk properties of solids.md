The density of a material is defined as its mass per unit volume, it measures how compact a substance is. Hooke's law states that extension directly proportional to the force applied to an object, given that environmental factors are constant. This can be seen on a force extension graph when the line plotted is straight.

The limit of proportionality is the point after which Hooke's law is no longer obeyed. The elastic limit comes after this point and after force is increased past it, the material will deform. Hookes law can be described by the equation:
$$\Huge F=k\Delta L$$
Where $k$ is the spring constant, $F$ is the force applied, and $L$ is the extension.

Tensile stress is the force applied per unit cross-sectional area. Tensile strain is caused by tensile stress, and is defined as the extension over the original length:
$$\Huge Stress=\frac{F}{A}$$
$$\Huge Strain=\frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
When work is done on a material in order to stretch or compress it, the energy put in is stored as elastic potential energy. This energy can be calculated by finding the area under a force extension graph:
$$\Huge E_{elastic}=\int (k\Delta L)dL=\frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^{2}=\frac{1}{2}k\Delta L\times \Delta L$$
$$\Huge F=k\Delta L$$
$$\Huge \frac{1}{2}k\Delta L\times \Delta L=\frac{1}{2}F\Delta L$$

Breaking stress is the value of stress at which a material will break apart. This is dependent on external conditions, like temperature. Force extenstion graphs can show properties of materias. There are two main behaviours that a material can exhibit;
\> Plastic: a material will experience a large amount of extension as force is increased, especially beyond the plastic limit
\> Brittle: a material extends a very little amount and is likely to break apart at low extension.

Once a material is stretched beyond its elastic limit, the force extension graph will no longer return to the origin when force is gradually decreased. The line that shows force decreasing against extension will be parallel to the original extension line, as the material will still have a constant stifness. The area between a loading and unloading line is the work done to deform the material. Loading is when a force is applied, and unloading is when a force is removed. If a material does not exceed its elastic limit, both lines will be identical.

When a stretch is elastic, all work done is stored as elastic strain energy. When a stretch is plastic, atoms are pulled apart and energy is no longer stored as elastic strain, and is instead dissapaited as heat.

When a spring is hung and stretched, kinetic energy is converted into elastic strain energy, and when the force is removed the energy is converted back into kinetic energy.

Stress-strain graphs are similar to force-extension graphs, however described the behaviour of a material as opposed to the behaviour of a specific object. They show a material's ultimate tensile stress (UTS), the maximum stress that a material can withstand. Their shape can also show if a material is ductile (can undergo a large amount of plastic deformation before breaking), brittle, or plastic.
