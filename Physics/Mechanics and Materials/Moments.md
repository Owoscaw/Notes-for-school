The moment of a force about a point is the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distane from the line of action of the force to the fixed point.

A couple is a pair of coplanar (same plane) forces where the two forces are equal in magnitude, however opposite in direction. To find the moment of a couple, you multiply one of the forces by the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces.

The principle of moments statws that for an object to be in rotational equilibrium, then the sum of anticlockwise moments about a pivot is equal to the sum of clockwise moments:
$$\Huge \sum clockwise\,\,moments=\sum anticlockwise\,\,moments$$

This can be used to find the distance between a force and a pivot or to find the magnitude of a force that is a known distance away from a pivot.

The centre of mass of an object is defined as the point on which gravity acts on an object. If said object is uniform, then it's centre of mass will be in its centre.
