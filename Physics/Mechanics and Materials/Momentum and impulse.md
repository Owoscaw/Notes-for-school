Momentum is the product of mass and velocity:
$$\Huge Momentum=mass\times velocity$$
$$\Huge p=mv$$
[[Conservation of energy]] dictates that momentum is always conserved in any interaction with no other external forces. This means that momentum before an interaction is equal to momentum after an interaction. This is used to find the velocity of objects after a collision.

[[Newton's laws of motion]] state that $F=ma$, through substitution of the formula for acceleration:
$$\Huge F=ma$$
$$\Huge a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$
$$\Huge F=m\left(\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\right)$$
$$\Huge F=\frac{\Delta mv}{\Delta t}$$
From this, it is clear that force is the same as the rate of change (first derivative) of momentum. Rearranging this gives:
$$\Huge F\Delta t=\Delta(mv)$$
Where $F$ is constant, and $t$ is impact time. $F\Delta t$ is known as impulse and is equal to the change in momentum.

Impulse is an important factor to consider when discussing the force experienced by an object during a collision, as a large change in momentum over a short time leads to a very large force experienced by an object. This is taken into consideration when designing safety features on cars.

There are two types of collision:
\> Elastic - both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved
\> Inelastic - only momentum is conserved (kinetic energy is converted into other forms)

If object stick togther after a collision, said collision was inelastic. An explosion is another example of an inelastic collision, as there was a net change in kinetic energy.
