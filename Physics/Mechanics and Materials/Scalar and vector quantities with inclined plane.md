Scalars and vectors are physical quantities, however scalars only describe a magnitude, while vectors describe both a magnitude and a direction. Some examples are:
\> Disance (scalar) - Displacement (vector)
\> Speed (scalar) - Velocity (vector)
\> Mass (scalar) - Force/Weight (vector)
\> Temperature (scalar)
\> Acceleration (vector)

Vectors can be added through two methods:

Calculation - This can be used when two vectors are perpendicular, Pythagoras's theorem can be used to find the resultant vector of two perpendicular vectors:
$$\Huge a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}$$
The direction can be found by taking the arctan of the opposite side over the adjacent side:

$$\Huge \theta=tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{12}\right)$$

Scale drawing - This can be used when vectors are at angles other than 90 degrees. Vectors are drawn to scale, according to a constant ratio (for example 1cm = 10N) and angles are drawn accuratley using a protractor. Resultant vectors can be found by drawing vectors accurately and from the end of one another:

Vectors can also be resolved, where they are broken down into horizonal and vertical components. This is done by forming a right angle triangle and trigonometric equations:

$$\Huge sin\,\theta =\frac{opp}{hyp}=\frac{y}{V}$$
$$\Huge Vsin\,\theta=y$$
$$\Huge cos\,\theta=\frac{adj}{hyp}=\frac{x}{V}$$
$$\Huge Vcos\,\theta=x$$

If an object is on an inclined plane, then the weight of the object will be split between the reaction force provided by the plane and the force acting on the object parallel to the plane. The magnitude of these forces depends on both the angle between the plane and the horizontal as well as the mass of the object:

An object is in equilibrium if there is no resultant vector acting upon it. This happens when the algebraic sum of all forces acting upon an object are zero. Newtons first law dictates that in this scenario, the object is stationary or moving at a constantn velocity. An object can be shown to be in equilibrium by either adding the horizontal and vertical components of all the forces acting on it or by scale diagram.
