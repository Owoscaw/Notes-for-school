The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred between forms. Therefore, the total energy in a closed system is constant. This is also true in particle interactions, see [[Particle interactions]].Total energy in will equal total energy out. For example, assuming that kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy are in a closed system, you can say that the change in total gravitational energy must equal the change in total kinetic energy:
$$\Huge \Delta E_{p}=\Delta mgh = \Delta E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$
Where:
\> $m$ is mass in kilogrammes
\> $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity
\> $h$ is height
\> $v$ is velocity

For example, when a ball is thrown in a closed system, the following graph holds true:
