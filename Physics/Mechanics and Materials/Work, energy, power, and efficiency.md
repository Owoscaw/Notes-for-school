Work done is defined as the force causign a motion multiplied by the distance travelled in the direction of force. This can be written as:
$$\Huge W=Fs\,cos\,\theta$$
For a force acting with magnitude $F$ at an angle of $\theta$ to the horizontal for $s$ metres. As work is a measure of energy transfer, the rate of doing work must be the rate of energy transfer, in other words:
$$\Huge P=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\frac{F\times\Delta s}{\Delta t}=Fv$$
This is because $\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ is the same as $v$. Therefore, on a Force-Displacement graph, the area under the graph will be equal to the work done. Note that electrical power, seen in [[Basics of electricity]] can be converted into mechanical power (seen above), however this conversion is not entirely efficient.

Efficiency is a measure of how efficiently a system transfers energy. It is calculated by dividing the useful power output by the total energy input:
$$\Huge Efficiency=\frac{useful\,\,power\,\,output}{input\,\,power}$$
