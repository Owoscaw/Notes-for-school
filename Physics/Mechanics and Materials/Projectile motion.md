The vertical and horizontal components of a vector are independant from one another, and can therefore be evaluated seperately under $suvat$ equations. See [[Scalar and vector quantities with inclined plane]] for more on the horizontal and vertical components of a vector.

Free fall is defined as when an object experiences a downwards acceleration of g. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object, it is also known as drag / air resistance when considering friction experienced in a fluid. These frictional forces convert kinetic energy into other forms, like heat and sound.

The magnitude of air resistance increases as the speed of an object increases.

Lift is an upwards force that acts upon objects travelling in a fluid, caused by the object creating a change in the direction of fluid flow. It acts perpendicular to the motion of fluid flow.

Terminal velocity occurs when the frictional forces acting upon an object become equal but opposite in magnitude to the driving forces acting upon an object. If an object has reached its terminal velocity then there is no longer a resultant force acting upon it, and it will be travelling at a constant velocity or it will be stationary, in accordance to Newton's first law (see [[Newton's laws of motion]]).
