\> Newton's first law: An object will remain at resat or travelling at a constant velocity until it experiences a resultant force
\> Newton's second law: The acceleration of an object is proportional to the resultant force experienced by the object, $F=ma$. Where $F$ is the resultant force, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $a$ is the acceleration that the object experiences
\> Newton's third law: For each force experienced by an object, the object exerts an equal and opposite force

A free body diagram is an abstraction that shows all the forces acting upon an object, without uneccesary detail, like the wheels on a car.

An object will be in translational equlilibrium if there is no resultant force acting upon it, this links to rotational equilibrium seen in [[Moments|moments]]. Newtons laws will dictate how an object moves along a straight line, [[Motion along a straight line]].
