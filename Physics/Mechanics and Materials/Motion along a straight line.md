\> Speed - a scalar quantity that describes how quickly an object is travelling
\> Displacement ($s$) - the overall distance travelled from the starting position
\> Velocity ($v$) - first derivative of displacement, $\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ 
\> Acceleration ($a$) - second derivative of displacement, $\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

For more on the derivative, see [[Differentiation]]

Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at any given specific point in time. Average velocity is the velocity of an object over a specific range of time. It is foundby taking the final displacement of an object and dividing it by the time it took to get there. Uniform acceleration is when an object has a constant acceleration:

Acceleration-time graphs represent the change in velocity over time, therefore the area under the graph is $\Delta v$.

Velocity-time graphs represent the change in velocity over time. Therefore, the gradient of this graph will be acceleration and the area under it, displacement.

Displacement-time graphs show change in displacement over time, their gradient represents velocity.

If an object has uniform acceleration, the following formulas will hold:
$$\Huge v=u+at$$
$$\Huge s=\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right)t$$
$$\Huge s=\int (u+at)\,dt=ut\,+\frac{at^{2}}{2}$$
$$\Huge v^{2}=u^{2}+2as$$
Where:
\> $s$ is displacement
\> $u$ is initial velocity
\> $v$ is final velocity
\> $a$ is acceleration
\> $t$ is time

The third formula, defining displacement as the integral of velocity, uses a process known as [[Integration]].
