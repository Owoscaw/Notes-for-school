Radioactive decay is a random process that occurs in unstable nuclei, it can take the form of [[Radioactivity|alpha, beta, or gamma]] radiation. A radioactive nucleus will have a given decay consant, $\lambda$, that represents the probability of a decay occuring over one unit time. The decay constant can only be used when there are a large amount of nuclei, as it is a statistical representation of decay. This is equivalent to the rate of change in the number of nuclei in a sample against time. i.e:
$$\Huge \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}=-\lambda N$$
Over long periods of time, the number of nuclei in a sample can be described using an exponential equation:
$$\Huge N=N_0\,e^{-\lambda t}$$
Where $N$ is the number of active nuclei, $N_0$ is the initial number of active nuclei, $\lambda$ is the decay constant for said nucleus, and $t$ is time passed. 

Due to the exponential nature of this process, the time taken for the number of active nuclei in a sample to half will remain constant:
$$\Huge 0.5N_0=N_0\,e^{-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
$$\Huge 0.5=e^{-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
$$\Large ln(0.5)=-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}\,\,\,\to\,\,\,t_{\frac{1}{2}}=-\frac{ln(0.5)}{\lambda}=-\frac{ln(1) - ln(2)}{\lambda}=\frac{ln(2)}{\lambda}$$
$$\Huge t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{ln(2)}{\lambda}$$
Where $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is the time taken for the number of active nuclei in a sample to halve, and $\lambda$ is the decay constant.

# Activity:

The activity of a sample is measured as the number of nuclei that decay in a sample per second. It follows that this will be equivalent to the product of the probablity of a decay happening per second, $\lambda$, and the number of nuclei in a sample, $N$:
$$\Huge A=\lambda N$$
As activity is proportional to the number of active nuclei, it follows the same exponential relationhip:
$$\Huge A=A_0\,e^{-\lambda t}$$
This also means that the half life for $N$ is the same as the half life for $A$.
