# Closest approach:

The radius of a nucleus can be estimated by calculating the closest distance that a charged particle can reach. As a positively charged particle of known kinetic energy is fired at a positive nucleus, its kinetic energy is converted into electrical potential as it begins to be repulsed. The distance of closest approach is the point at which this particle will stop and begin accelerating in the other direction:
$$\Huge E_k=E_V:$$
$$\huge \frac{1}{2}m_{particle}v^2=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q_{particle}Q_{nucleus}}{r}$$
# Electron diffraction:

Electrons do not interact with nucleons through the strong nuclear force, as they are leptons. This means that a much more accurate approximation for nuclear radius. In this experiment, electrons are accelerated such that their [[de Broglie hypothesis|de Broglie wavelength]] is around $10^{-15}m$. They are then directed through a very thin crystaline lattice, where they diffract between the gaps in the nuclei and form a diffraction pattern:

This produces a pattern similar to this graph:
