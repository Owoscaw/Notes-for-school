# Closest approach:

The radius of a nucleus can be estimated by calculating the closest distance that a charged particle can reach. As a positively charged particle of known kinetic energy is fired at a positive nucleus, its kinetic energy is converted into electrical potential as it begins to be repulsed. The distance of closest approach is the point at which this particle will stop and begin accelerating in the other direction:
$$\Huge E_k=E_V:$$
$$\huge \frac{1}{2}m_{particle}v^2=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q_{particle}Q_{nucleus}}{r}$$
# Electron diffraction:

Electrons do not interact with nucleons through the strong nuclear force, as they are leptons. This means that a much more accurate approximation for nuclear radius. In this experiment, electrons are accelerated such that their [[de Broglie hypothesis|de Broglie wavelength]] is around $10^{-15}m$. They are then directed through a very thin crystaline lattice, where they diffract between the gaps in the nuclei and form a diffraction pattern:

This produces a pattern similar to this graph:
![[Electron diffraction pattern.png|450]]
This set up is identical to the [[Refraction, diffraction, and interference|diffraction grating]] experiment, so the formula below can be used:
$$\Huge d\,sin\theta=n\lambda$$
This is adapted to fit the scenario by rearranging and replacing variables:
$$\Huge sin\theta=\frac{0.61\lambda}{R}$$
Where $\theta$ is the diffraction angle, $\lambda$ is the de broglie wavelength of the electron, and $R$ is the nuclear radius. This experiment showed that the nuclear radius for any nucleus was about $10^{-15}m$, however this value varies with the amount of nucleons in the nucleus. The radius of any nucleus is given by:
$$\Huge R=R_0A^{\frac{1}{3}}$$
Where $R$ is nuclear radius, $R_0$ is a constant with a value of about $1.4fm$, and $A$ is the number of nucleons. Using this formula, it can be shown that nuclear density is the same for any nucleus:
$$\large \rho_{nuclear} = \frac{m}{v}=\frac{A\times m_{nucleon}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}=\frac{3A\,m_{nucleon}}{4\pi \left(R_0A^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^3}=\frac{3Am_{nucleon}}{4\pi R_0^3A}=\frac{3m_{nucleon}}{4\pi R_0^3}=k$$
Since $m_{nucleon}$ and $R_0$ are constants, $\rho_{nuclear}$ must also be a constant. This can be caluclated to show that nuclear density is about $1.45\times10^{17}kg\,m^{-3}$.
