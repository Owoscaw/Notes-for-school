# Fission:

Nuclear fission involved splitting a large nucleus into two smaller, daughter nuclei. This is a random process that occurs in very large, unstable nuclei. Energy is released in this process, as daughter nuclei have a higher binding energy per nucleon than the original nuclei. The difference in binding energy per nucleon between parent and daughter nuclei is released and can be used for power generation.

In this process, a neutron is fired at a uranium-235 nucleus. The neutron fuses with the uranium and becomes uranium-236, a very unstable nucleus. The fusing of the neutron causes the nucleus to elongate and split into two daughter nuclei. Some neutrons are also released in the splitting, as well as energy.

Fission is used in nuclear power plants, and does not emit greenhouse gasses. However, the products of nuclear fission are radioactive and will remain so for thousands of years. This waste needs to be stored safely as it is harmful to the human body.

## Induced fission:
Fission is induced in certain heavy elements by firing a thermal neutron into the nucleus. Thermal neutrons have a low energy, whearas high energy neutrons will rebound off of heavy nuclei. When the thermal neutron collides with the nucleus of a heavy element (e.g. uranium-235), the nucleus becomes very unstable. The nucleus then splits into daughter nuclei, releasing some neutrons and energy in the process. These neutrons go on to collide with more uranium-235 

# Fusion:

Nuclear fusion is the opposite process of fission, two smaller nuclei are joined together to form a single larger nucleus. This typically only occurs in small nuclei. Energy is released during nuclear fusion, as the resulting nucleus has much higher binding energy per nucleon. Fusion produces much more energy than fission, however requires extremely high temperatures and pressures.

The electrostatic force between protons needs to be overcome to the point where the [[Particle interactions|strong nuclear force]] between nucleons is dominant. At this point, the SNF pulls nucleons towards each other where they fuse into one nucleus, releasing energy and forming a larger nucleus. The difference in [[Mass and Energy|binding energy per nucleon]] between the two initial nuclei and the resulting nuclei is released as energy.
