# Fission:

Nuclear fission involved splitting a large nucleus into two smaller, daughter nuclei. This is a random process that occurs in very large, unstable nuclei. Energy is released in this process, as daughter nuclei have a higher binding energy per nucleon than the original nuclei. The difference in binding energy per nucleon between parent and daughter nuclei is released and can be used for power generation.

In this process, a neutron is fired at a uranium-235 nucleus. The neutron fuses with the uranium and becomes uranium-236, a very unstable nucleus. The fusing of the neutron causes the nucleus to elongate and split into two daughter nuclei. Some neutrons are also released in the splitting, as well as energy.

Fission is used in nuclear power plants, and does not emit greenhouse gasses. However, the products of nuclear fission are radioactive and will remain so for thousands of years. This waste needs to be stored safely as it is harmful to the human body.

## Induced fission:

Fission is induced in certain heavy elements by firing a thermal neutron into the nucleus. Thermal neutrons have a low energy, whearas high energy neutrons will rebound off of heavy nuclei. When the thermal neutron collides with the nucleus of a heavy element (e.g. uranium-235), the nucleus becomes very unstable. The nucleus then splits into daughter nuclei, releasing some neutrons and energy in the process. These neutrons go on to collide with more uranium-235, which cause more fission reactions. Each fission reaction caused by each neutron causes another fission reaction, and so on and so forth.

## Fuel requirements:

The critical mass is the minimum mass of fuel required to maintain a steady chain reaction of fission. It is at this mass of nuclear fuel that the reactions caused by neutron emissions in fission causes exactly one other fission reaction. 

If there is less mass than the critical mass, uranium nuclei will be too far away from each other for any emitted neutrons to cause more fission reactions. This is only as statistical generalisation, as there is always a chance that a uranium nucleus will be close enough to cause more fission reactions. Using sub critical mass will cause the reaction to start up, but it will not sustain itself and eventually die out.

If there is more mass than the critical mass, uranium nuclei will be too close together to control. Over all nuclei in the mass of fuel, in general, one fission reaction will cause more than one other fission reaction, and it will continue to accelerate. This makes the chain reaction keep accelerating beyond control.

# Nuclear reactors:

A nuclear reactor makes use of the excess energy produced by nuclear fission to heat up water and turn a turbine. Reactors typically use uranium-235. 

## Moderators:

The moderator is a key part of a nuclear reactor. It slows down neutrons released furing fission to thermal speeds through elastic collisions between the moderator atoms and neutrons. The closer the moderator atoms are in size to the neutrons, the larger proportion of the neutron's momentum is transferred, slowing them down to a greater degree.

The moderator is designed to slow neutrons down. This will lower the number of neutrons with sufficient speed to cause more fission reactions, controlling the "criticality" of the chain reaction. Water is often used as a moderator, due to its hydrogen content (a relatively small nucleus). 

## Control rods:

These are used to absorb neutrons in order to contain chain reactions. The height of the control rods can be controlled, controlling the rate at which fission reactions happen, controlling the amount of energy produced. These need to be made of materials that do not undergo fission when struck with a neutron.

## Coolant:

Coolant absorbs the heat released by fission in the reactor core. This heat is used to make steam, turning a turbine which then produced electricity.

## Safety considerations:

When uranium is mined, it is 99% U-238. It needs to be enriched to the point where it is between 3-5% U-235. This is considered reactor grade uranium and is used for fission. The remaining U-238 in the fuel absorbs fission neutrons and can help control the rate of fission reactions.

Control rods are lowered into the core remotely to limit radioactive exposure to workers. The reactor is also covered in thick concrete to avoid radiation escaping to the rest of the power plant. In an emergency, the control rods are fully dropped into the core, absorbing all neutrons and stopping any more fission reactions from propagating. This is what failed 


# Fusion:

Nuclear fusion is the opposite process of fission, two smaller nuclei are joined together to form a single larger nucleus. This typically only occurs in small nuclei. Energy is released during nuclear fusion, as the resulting nucleus has much higher binding energy per nucleon. Fusion produces much more energy than fission, however requires extremely high temperatures and pressures.

The electrostatic force between protons needs to be overcome to the point where the [[Particle interactions|strong nuclear force]] between nucleons is dominant. At this point, the SNF pulls nucleons towards each other where they fuse into one nucleus, releasing energy and forming a larger nucleus. The difference in [[Mass and Energy|binding energy per nucleon]] between the two initial nuclei and the resulting nuclei is released as energy.
