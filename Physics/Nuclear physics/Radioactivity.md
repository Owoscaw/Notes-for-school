# Rutherford scattering:

Rutherford's scattering experiments proved the existance of the nucleus. The existing model of the atom at the time of the experiment was the plum pudding model. This involved modelling the atom as a positively charged sphere with negative charges stuck to it, like a plum pudding.

During the experiment, alpha particles were fired at gold foil inside a chamber with a fluorescent coating. This coating showed where alpha particles hit. It was beleived that all alpha particles would pass through the foil, as this was consistent with the plum pudding model. However, it was observed that some particles would be deflected at a variety of angles. This was explained by a positively charged nucleus at the centre of a gold atom, which deflected the positively charged alpha particle.

# $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ radiation:

Radiation is the phenomenon that occurs when an [[Stable and unstable nuclei|unstable nucleus]] emits energy in the form of either an alpha particle, electron, or EM radiation. Any of these emissions cause a nucleus to become more stable:

## $\alpha$ radiation:

Alpha radiation is the same as a helium nucleus, two protons and two neutrons. It is highly ionising as it is huge compared to other forms of radiation. Its range is 2-10 cm in air and can be stopped by paper. Since it has an overall charge, it is affected by both magnetic and electric fields.

##  $\beta$ radation:

Beta radiation is the same as the emission of an electron. It has a range of around 1m in air and is mildly ionising, as it is small compared to an alpha particle, however large compared to a photon. As an electron is charged, beta radiation is affected by both magnetic and electric fields.

## $\gamma$ radiation:

Gamma radiation is the same as the emission of an EM wave. It has infinite range, however, intensity follows the inverse square law of EM radiation. It is very weakly ionising, depending on the wavelength emitted.

As gamma radiation spreads in all directions as it propagates, the inverse square law of radiation holds true:
$$\Huge I=\frac{k}{x^2}$$
Where $I$ is the intensity of radiation, $x$ is the distance from the source, and $k$ is a constant. As gamma radiation is inifnite in range, background radiation exists wherever it is being measured. To account for this, during experiements involving gamma radiation, the count rate observed needs to be corrected. This is done by measuring the rate before a source is introduced and subtracting it from any reading:
$$\large Corrected\,\,Count=Observed\,\,Count-Background\,\,Count$$
