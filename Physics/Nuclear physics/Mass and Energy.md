On the scale of nuclear physics, mass and energy become interchangable according to Einsteins' famous equation:
$$\Huge E=mc^2$$
However, when comparing the mass of a nucleus to the total mass of its constituents, the apparent mass of the nucleus will always be lower than the sum of its parts. This is called mass defect.

# Mass defect + binding energy:

The apparent mass of a nucleus will always be less than the sum of the masses of the nucleons inside said nucleus. This difference is known as mass defect. Mass defect is the "lost" mass that is converted into energy and releasead when the nucleons fuse to form the nucleus. Mass defect is measured in atomic units, as it is often incredibley small.

The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to overcome a nucleus' energy well and split it into nucleons, equivalent to the energy released when the nucleus initially fused. Using atomic units, $E=mc^2$ can be adapted into a simpler form:
$$\Large E_{J}=m_{kg}\times c^2=1.661\times 10^{-27}m_u\times c^2$$
$$\Large 1.6\times10^{-19}E_{eV}=1.661\times10^{-27}\times c^2\times m_u$$
$$\huge E_{eV}=\frac{1.661\times10^{-27}\times c^2}{1.6\times10^{-19}}m_u$$
$$\Huge E_{eV}=m_u\times931.5\,MeV$$
