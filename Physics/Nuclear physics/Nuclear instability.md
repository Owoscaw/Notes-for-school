# N-Z ratio

Inside the nucleus, the [[Particle interactions|strong nuclear force]] between all nucleons and the [[Electric Fields|electrostatic force]] between protons oppose each other. The magnitude of these forces depends on the amount of protons and neutrons inside a nucleus, and the dominant force depends on their ratio. This ratio is determined by the ratio of neutrons to protons in a nucleus, shown by the N-Z curve:

After about 20 of each proton and neutron, the rate at which the electrostatic force increases becomes greater than the rate at which the strong nuclear force increases. This causes the line of stable nuclei to deviate from N=Z, as more neutrons are needed to counteract the electrostatic force from the increasing amount of protons and keep the forces in the nucleus stable.

# Decay conditions:

When a nucleus has too many neutrons, beta-minus decay occurs. A neutron is converted into a proton, emitting a beta minus particle (electron) as well as an electron anti-neutrino.

When a nucleus has too many protons, beta-plus decay or electron capture occurs. In either case, a proton is converted into a neutron.

When a nucleus has too many nucleons in general, alpha decay occurs. 

When a nucleus has too much energy, electron orbits are rearranged and gamma emission occurs.


# Decay diagrams:

Nuclear decays can be represented using energy level diagrams that show the difference in energy for a particle. For example, the below reaction is represented using the graph.
$$\Huge ^{238}_{92}U \to ^{234}_{90}Th\,+^{4}_{2}\alpha$$
