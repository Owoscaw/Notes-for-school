A dictionary is an [[Queues and ADTs|ADT]] made up of pairs. Each pair consists of a key and a value, where the value is accessed using the key. In python, a dictionary is a built-in data type. Dictionaries are useful for looking things up, for example ASCII tables or translation programs. Multiple items with the same key are not allowed, but the value associated with a key can be any data type. Methods associated with a dictionary are: Add a new key:value pair, delete a key:value pair, Amend the value in a key:value pair, Return the value associated with a key, Return the length of a dictionary, and Return a Boolean determining whether or not a key is in the dictionary.



Key:Value pairs are not held in any particular order, their addresses are calculated using a hashing algorithm. Dictionaries are often used to represent an adjacency matrix for a network, see [[Graph theory]].
