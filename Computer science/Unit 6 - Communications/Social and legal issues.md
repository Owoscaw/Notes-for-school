How has our connected, online world enables us to distribute personal information. Facebook collects vast amounts of personal data. This data is used to create personal advertisements that are designed to sell as much product as possible. Goblins are real. 

There are many disadvangeges to social media, like internet trolling, cyberbullying, anonymous blogs, and hate sites (reddit).

While the internet is a free for all, if a law is broken in your operating country, you can still be persecuted according to said law despite actions being on the internet. Many government agencies therefore monitor its citizens internet use. Technology can be used to make the world a better place, as well as for malicious intent (hate crimes). This begs the question if morality should be a factor in technological design. 

ICT systems are now being used to determine healthcare availability and education eligibility, so these systems can heavily affect one's future. Driverless cars will be real soon. Any product developed can be used for harm, but should the developer of said product be to blame??

Should the inventor of reddit be held accountable for the atrocities that take place on a daily basis on that cess pit of a website?

Software and algorithms made by humans are taking over decisions that humans used to make, this can include online advertisements, maps, crime hotspots (based off crime rate and reoffending rates). However, this suggests that algorithms can make ethical decisions, which may not be true as computer algorithms are based on complex rules that can make it challenging to predict their decisions, which may not always align with the human definition of "moral". A decision that a computer makes is only as based as the data that it uses.

Data mining is the process that looks at large data sets and identifies patterns in order to predict things. Algorithms are often a lot better at this than human analysts.

[[Algorithms]] and software can often embed moral and cultural values, for example free speech and freedom of press. Social media tends to enshrine democratic western principles, like freedom of speech and expression. Computer programmers therefore have the potential to cause great good and great harm, as the platform that they create can be used to organised protests, and terrorist events. Employers can now look into your past on these social media platform, even if posts you made back then do not reflect the content of your character now. These developers are therefore responsible for activities that take place on their platform, and should ensure no harm comes to children, no defamation or fake news spreads, and no terror activities are organised. 

The TOR (The Onion bRowser) browser is used to provide anonymity for people on the internet. It was originally developed for the American military, however has seen use for the selling of narcotics and other illegal items. The surface web describes the internet that can be accessed directly from a regular browser. The deep web describes content that cannot be accessed directly from a browser, however is not illegal. The dark web describes content that is only accessible for encrypted browsers, like TOR. The surface web only accounts for around 10% of all content on the internet.

There is need for new legislation regarding the internet, social media, and the dark web as the computer misuse at was written in a different age of the internet. However, encryption and anonymity makes enforcement difficult. Laws also vary from country to country, it is also hard to keep up with current technology like VR.
