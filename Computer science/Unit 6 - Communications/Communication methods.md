Serial data cables include the USB (Universal Serial Bus) standard, parallel cables are a ribbon of several smaller cables used typically for internal components in a computer. Parallel cables are used for smaller distances, as they are physically more wires and therefore more cost. In parallel cables, bits are sent simultaneously down the cable so that an entire byte or bytes can be sent at once. In a serial cable, bits can only be sent one at a time. In addition to the wires for data, additional wires are needed in both cable type for control signals and ground wire. Busses connecting internal computer components are a type of parallel cable. See [[Internal hardware]].

Serial connectors were used in the early days of computing to send the majority of data, which were reliable but slow. In parallel cable, twice the amount of lines are required for two-way communication. Parallel cable is limited to about 10Â m due to interference between lines and signal fading.

The problem with parralel connectors is that each line has slightly different properties, which may cause bits to arrive at different times because bits travel at different speeds due to the impurity of each line. This problem is known as skew.



Crosstalk is also introduced due to the electromagnetic interference between two adjacent lines in a parallel connection. As frequency (speed of transmission) increases, so does the amount of crosstalk. This can cause data to be corrupted, in which case it will need to be retransmitted. Shielded twisted pair wraps lines in an aluminium foil in order to reduce or eliminate interference from other cables.



Serial cables do not encounter any of these issues, as there is only one line for one way communications. This makes serial cables much more reliable over distance and at a range of high frequency data transmissions. Serial cables are also much cheaper than parallel connectors.
