There are two main ways of sending data over a cable, serial and parallel. Each have their advantages and disadvantages.

# Serial:

The most widely used serial cable is the USB (Universal Serial Bus) standard. In series transmission, bits are sent in sequence, one after another. These can be slow as only one bit is sent at a time, however clock rates can be raised to much higher frequencies than parallel cable due to the abscence of crosstalk. Serial cables are optimal for longer range transmission, due to the abscence of crosstalk and the relatively cheap manufacturing cost.

# Parallel:

Parallel cables consist of many data channels from end to end. Many bits can therefore be sent simultaniously, increasing bitrate. These cables have a much higher bandwidth than serial connectors, and are commonly used as busses for [[Internal hardware|internal hardware]]. 

The major disadvantages of parallel transmission are crosstalk and skew. Over a long distance, faint electrical fields created by each channel in the cable can cause interference in other channels, which can often lead to data loss. Skew happens when data is delayed in its path and does not reach its destination at the same time as the other bits that were sent along with it. This causes the overall message sent to be lost.
