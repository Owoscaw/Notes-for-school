Mathematician Alan Turing created a theoretical machine that could carry out any computer algorithm, no matter how complex. A turing machine can be viewd as a computer with a single fixed program, expressed using a finite set of sets in a state transition diagram.

A Turing machine consists of two parts, a theoretically infinite tape of 0s or 1s that the machien can read or write to, and the controller. The controller determines what happens at each cell. The machine must have a start state and a halting state, that causes the machine to halt at certain inputs. The controller can read the current symbol, erase or write a new symbol, or move left and right along the tape.

## Transition functions:

When using Turing machines, state transition diagrames, and their associated transition rules, a transition function can be used. $\delta$ can be used to represent a transition function:
$$\Large \delta \left(current\,\,state,\,\,input \right) = \left(new\,\,state,\,\,output,\,\,direction\right)$$
