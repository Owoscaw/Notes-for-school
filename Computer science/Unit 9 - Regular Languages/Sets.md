Sets are a way of grouping objects together as a single entity, in this way it is an abstraction. The laws that govern sets form the basis for boolean algebra. The cardinality of a set is the number of members in said set, denoted as $|A|$. A set is a well-defined collection of unordered objects (members or elements) that appear only once. For example:
$$\large C=\{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\}$$
$$\large S=\{0,...,99\}$$
Here, $C$ represents the set of colours in the rainbow, $blue$ is a member of set $C$. Set $S$ represents the set of integers from 0 to 99 inclusive, $45$ is a member of set $S$. These are commonly used sets:
$$\Huge \mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,..., \mathbb{Z}^+\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{Z}^+=\{1,2,3,...\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{Q}=\{0.\dot{01},0.\dot{0}2, \frac{3}{4},\frac{1}{3}, \mathbb{Z},\mathbb{N},...\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{R}=\{\mathbb{Q}, \pi,e,\phi,\sqrt{2},...\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{C}=\{\mathbb{R}, i, 1+i,e+\sqrt{2}i,e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}},...\}$$
$$\Huge \emptyset=\{\}$$
The character $\in$ is used to denote membership of a set, for example $n\in\mathbb{N}$ means that $n$ is a member of the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$. The $|$ symbol denotes "such that", and the ^ symbol denotes "and". For example:
$$\Large S=\{x|\,\,x\in\mathbb{N}\textasciicircum x\,\,is\,\,even\}$$
Here, $S$ denotes the set of natural numbers that are even.

## Set operators:

There are three main set operations:
> Union, $A\cup B$, represents the set of all members that are in either A and B
> Intersection, $A\cap B$, represents the set of all members in both A and B
> Difference, $A\textbackslash B$, represents the set of all members in A, but not in B

## Subsets:

If $A$ is a subset of $B$, every member of $A$ is also a member of $B$, $A$ is also a member of $B$. $A$ is not a subset of $B$ when at least one member of $A$ is not a member of $B$. $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ when $A$ is a subset of $B$, but they are not the same set:
$$\Huge A\subseteq B\,\,\,\,\,\,A\not\subseteq B\,\,\,\,\,A\subset B$$

## Cartesian product:

The cartesian product of two sets, $A$ and $B$, is the set of all ordered pairs, $(a, b)$ such that $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. It is written as:
$$\Huge A\times B=\{(a,b)|\,a\in A\,,b\in B\}$$
