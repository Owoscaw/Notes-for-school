Sets are a way of grouping objects together as a single entity, in this way it is an abstraction. The laws that govern sets form the basis for boolean algebra. A set is a well-defined collection of unordered objects (members or elements) that appear only once. For example:
$$\large C=\{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\}$$
$$\large S=\{0,...,99\}$$
Here, $C$ represents the set of colours in the rainbow, $blue$ is a member of set $C$. Set $S$ represents the set of integers from 0 to 99 inclusive, $45$ is a member of set $S$. These are commonly used sets:
$$\Huge \mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,...\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{Z}^+=\{1,2,3,...\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{Q}=\{0.\dot{01},0.\dot{0}2,...\}$$
$$\Huge \emptyset=\{\}$$
The character $\in$ is used to denote membership of a set, for example $n\in\mathbb{N}$ means that $n$ is a member of the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$. The $|$ symbol denotes "such that", and the ^ symbol denotes "and". For example:
$$\Large S=\{x|\,\,x\in\mathbb{N}\textasciicircum x\,\,is\,\,even\}$$
Here, $S$ denotes the set of natural numbers that are even.
