## Traditional development:

In a tradional lifecycle for a system, there are 5 main stages:
> Analysis
> Design
> Implementation
> Evaluation
> Maintenance

Each stage has to finish before the next can begin.

## Agile development:

Agile development is more modern and fast-paced than traditional development. Through this approach, constant feedback from the user is fed back to the development team. This often resutlts in a system being better suited to customers needs, because they have more input in the development process.

There is often miscommunication between the analyst and the customer, due to misunderstanding on either party's behalf. Via agile development, this problem is circumnvented through constant feedback and redesign.

At each stage of the agile development process, a prototype is built or developed with user participation. This will help the design team taylor the end product to the users needs.

## Analysis:

This process involves evaluating the user's needs, defining the problem. Throughout analysis, four main aspects of a system will be discussed:
>Data
>Procedures
>Future
>Problems

In agile development, a prototype may be built that can be iterated upon to understand the customer's needs at a deeper level.

Data in a new system needs to be organised and related such that it represents the real world as accurately as possible. This is often done through relationship modelling, OOP inheritances, or other approaches.

## Design:

>A modular structure is defined
>Data structures are agreed upon
>UI is designed
>Algorithms are designed

Designs can be prototyped so that the user can provide feedback on the system at this stage. This allows improvements to be made based off of their feedback.

## Implementation:

This stage involves the coding of the system. Programmers have to be flexible and responsive at this stage, as this is where changes will be made based off of the customer's feedback.

## Testing:

There are three types of testing:
>Module
>System
>Acceptance

Testing takes place using normal, boundary, and erroneous data. Module testing invovles testing each module of code at a time, system testing involves testing an entire system at once. Acceptance testing is undertaken with or by the user of the system using the final build environment with realistic data flow.

## Evaluation:

This may take place over a long time period, allowing time for users to get used to and use the system extensively. This allows for users to evaluate the system's effectiveness, usability, and maintainability.
