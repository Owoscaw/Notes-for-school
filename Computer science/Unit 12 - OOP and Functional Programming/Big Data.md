Big data is generally classed as data that is too large to store on a single conventional server, and is generally unstructured. It is collected on such a large scale that it is not easily analysed. Big data analysis is used to seek out patterns, the most prevelant example would be suggestions for online shopping.

There are three major characteristics of big data:
> Volume - big data is too big to be handled by a single server
> Velocity - the rate at which the data set is added to
> Variety - data can be audio, text, image, structured, unstructured e.c.t.
