The concept of a stored program computer uses the idea of storing data and instructions in some form of main memory and moving them between components. There are two implimentations of this, Von Neumann architecture, and Harvard architecture.

# Von Neumann:

In a Von Neumann architecture, a processor, memory unit, secondary storage, and buses are used to execute instructions and store their results. Both instruction and data are stored together in one block of main memory. This required 3 [[Internal hardware|busses]] to run through each component; data, control, and address.

# Harvard:

Harvard architecture involves keeping address memory and data memory seperate from one another, using two seperate modules. This means that seperate buses are used to fetch data and instruciton. Many embedded systems use harvard architecture, particularly digital signal processors.
