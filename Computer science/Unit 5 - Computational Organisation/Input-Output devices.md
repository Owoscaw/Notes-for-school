A user interacts with a computer using input devices, which send information to the [[Internal hardware]] of a computer. A computer may respond using an output device. Some of these devices are as follows.





Barcode readers have many uses in the real world. Barcode readers work by detected light that is incident on the barcode. The frequency of reflected light determines the spacing of each bar and can therefore be used to read the barcode. The barcode can then cross-referencedced with a database to find the details of the item, this can also be used with a stock control system in order to manage stock. There are two common types of barcode system, UPCA (Universal Product Code version A) and code 128. Code 128 can represent letters as well as number, whereas UPCA can only represent numbers.

In UPCA, guard bars are using to distinguish the end of the barcode, as well as a central guard to identify left and right. These guard bars allow a barcode reader to determine if it is reading the barcode from up or down, which allows a barcode to be read from any angle. Check digits are also used as a form of error detection. Codes on the right of a central guard bar have an even amount of black bars, and left codes always have an even amount. This helps determine the actual barcode if it is read from the wrong angle.

QR, quick response, codes are 2D barcode that can be read by smartphones or tablets. They represent a string of text which can contain a link or other information.

Digital cameras work in the same way as a scanner. When a digital camera captures an image, it breaks up the captured image into a grid of pixels. The shutter is opened to let light onto a CCD (Charged Couple Device) or a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor at the back of the lens. Light intensity and frequency is measured by millions of tiny sensor (one per pixel) that are arranged in a grid on the sensor. Light levels are represented as binary values, which are then stored as a bitmap in the camera's memory. Red, blue, or green filters can be used with different sensors to separate out wavelengths of light, a given sensor receives either red, green, or blue light. The intensity of each of the colours is then measured and stored as an aggregate RGB value.

Laser printers work using dry powdered ink called toner. A print drum is given a negative charge, and a laser shines the reverse image of a page into the drum. Said light reverses the charge on that specific part of the drum. Because the toner is negatively charged, it sticks to the positively charged image. This toner is then fused to the sheet of paper through a heat roller. Toner comes in cyan, yellow, magenta, and black. Combinations of these toners comprise any printed image.

RFID (Radio Frequency ID) uses a transmitter and receiver using RF EM waves to transmit data between devices. This system can be used for identification, tracking, and banking. An RFID circuit can be active or passive. In a passive RFID circuit, the current induced from incident radio waves is used to power the circuit and transmit data back to the transmitter. These usually need to be very close to the transmitted in order to become significantly powered. Active RFID circuits have their own power source that is used to transmit a signal much further than passive RFID circuits.
