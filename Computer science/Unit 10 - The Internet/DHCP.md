DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used for the automatic assignment of IP addresses and any other network configuration information. This allows limited pools of dynamic IP addresses to be shared out between hosts, and are freed up when not in use. Hosts can therefore reconfigure themselves when moving between networks, which reduces the total number of [[IP adresses]] required locally, as not all hosts will require network access at the same time.

DHCP can assign a limited number of temporary IP addresses to transient devices operating within a local hotspot. The DHCPDISCOVER command is broadcast to all connectet devices and is used to request an IP address. DHCPOFFER is a command issued by the DHCP server on a local network that is sent to only the client that broadcast the DHCPDISCOVER command. This command will contain the information about the temporary IP address, including the time for which the address will be allocated and the IP address of the DHCP server. DHCPREQUEST is broadcast from a client to all connected devices, which is discovered by the DHCP server that send the DHCPOFFER command. This is used to confirm the client's request of the IP address that the DHCP server offered it. Finally, the DHCP server sends back the DHCPACK command, which is an acknowledgement of the request and assigns the agreed IP address to the client.
