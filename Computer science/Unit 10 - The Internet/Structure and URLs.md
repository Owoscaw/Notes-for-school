The internet is a series of routable connections, specifically the largest series of routable connections that is public. Computers communicate with each other using networks, the internet being the biggest. The World Wide Web is different, it is  a collection of resources that can be accessed via the internet. The "hidden web" describes content hidden behind logins, content that is not searchable via search engines. The "deep web" describes content that required an encrypted search engine in order to access.

If the destination for data traffic is known (for example a MAC address), it is directed via the internet to reach the destination. MAC addresses for the next successive hop are needed in order to route data through multiple nodes. These addresses and routes are stored in the router on what's called a "routing table". 

The main part of the internet is known as the backbone, a set of dedicated connections that connect several large networks at various locations on the globe. Each of these locations are then connected to regional networks, typically controlled by ISPs (Internet Service Providers). ISPs each provide services to end users, for example website filtering and device specific blocks. ISPs are required to record web access by law, so that government agencies can view the records for law enforcement.

Every mile or so, there are junction boxes along subsea internet cables. This is so sections of the cable can be pulled up and repaired instead of repairing the entire cable. Each device on a network needs to be identified uniquely so that data can be sent to the correct destination. This is often written in the form "255.255.255.255", where each number between the dots is a number between 0 and 255. This is IPV4. IPV6 is a newer, updated version of the internet protocol (IP) addressing system that can provide exponentially more IP addresses. There are some "reserved" IP addresses, for example, any IP address beginning with 10 is reserved for private networks. These addresses are used for internal communication within a network and are not used on the internet. IPV6 is not currently in use.

FDQN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is the name of a network that can be broken down into parts, including a host name and the domain name. For example, "[www.bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk)" is broken into "[www.](http://www.)" for the host, "bbc.co.uk" for the domain name. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to specift the means of accessing a resource and its location across a network. The protocol and the domain name of the resource form the URL. For example, "<http://www.bbc.co.uk/index.html>" is broken into "http://" as the resource required (http web page) "[www.](http://www.)" as the host and "bbc.co.uk/" as the domain" and "index.html" as the resource.

A Domain Name Server (DNS) is a server dedicated to providing the IP address of a domain name. It converts "google.com" into 216.58.209.99 so that the computer that queried a DNS server can use the IP returned to communicate with the domain. There are 13 root domain name servers that sit upon all other DNS servers. All DNS servers work together in order to catalogue every domain name on the internet. These are segmented into regional groupings. There are layers to this, eg "bbc.co.uk" contains 3 DNS lookups, bbc at the bottom level, then co, then uk. If a DNS server cannot find an IP address for a queried URL in their database, it will recursively search other DNS server and computers to find a URL, or return an error message.

IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has the global responsibility for IP addresses and domain names. They delegate responsibility for allocating IP addresses to five Internet Registries. Domain name registration is delegated to many Domain Registrars. Domain names must be unique, but two domains can have the same name if they belong to a different higher level domains, (e.g. "bbc.com" and "bbc.co.uk"). A device can have a dynamic IP address that changes every time it accesses the internet. The organisation responsible for IP allocation in Europe is called "RIPE NCC". Domain names are purchasable from internet registrars that can offer domain names with different TLDs (Top Level Domains, like .com and .net).
