Malware, or malicious software, is software designed to annoy the user or damage their data and otherwise breach security. Worms and viruses are types of malware that can self replicate and spread across a network. A virus can infect other programs and data files so that it is embedded inside it. [[Security on the internet|Digital signatures]] can be used to authenticate that a file is the same file that was sent from a trusted recipient and has not been embedded with malware.

Trojans are a type of malware that masquerade as something useful or harmless, however contain other malicious software that can monitor keystrokes or open up your computer to remote access.

Phising is the act of deception and manipulation of a user in order to gain personal information that is used for their own good. They usually create a sense of urgency within the user, so they do not think before clicking a link.

Code quality together with monitoring unauthorised access attempts can significantly reduce threats from malware and hackers to a programmer's application. Measures can include:
\> Guarding against buffer overflow attacks
\> Gaurding against SQL injection attacks
\> Encouraging or requiring strong passwords
\> 2FA
\> Management of access rights

Buffer overflow is when a program attempts to write data to a location that is too small. This results in the overflowed data ending up in a neighbouring space. This can be utilised in a way such that the overflowed data is read as an instruction and is executed. This is only an issue for von-neumann architecture, as data and structure are stored in the same memory.

An SQL injection happens when a user enters SQL commands into an input field. They may enter characters that end the line in the SQL code that requests input and executes the code that they enter afterwards. This can allow users with malicious intent to access an SQL database. HHowever, an easy way to combat this is to ignore any characters after a semicolon, so that the SQL code part of the input is not read.

Monitoring can protect against the threat of hacking, which can introduce malware. Constant monitoring of a network and network traffic protects against hackers accessing users data or installing a packet sniffer.

Maintaining the integrity of operating systems and other applications reduces the amoutn of vulnerablities in a system. Keeping anti-malware software up to date can prevent the spread of infection.
