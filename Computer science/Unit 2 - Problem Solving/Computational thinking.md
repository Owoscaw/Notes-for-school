Computational thinking is working out how to work things out, the ability to think logically in regards to a problem and apply relevant techniques to solve them. 

There are many methods to solve a problem:
\> simulation
\> enumeration – list all cases
\> trial and error
\> theoretical approach
\> creative solution
\> and more....

Enumeration is also known as brute force, computers are very good at this because they are fast. This is often used to solve anagrams, every possible combination of the letters is tested to see if it is a word – which is then returned.

Different methods of solving a problem may be favoured (like not using enumeration for defusing a bomb).
