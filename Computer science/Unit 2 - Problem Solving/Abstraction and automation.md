Abstraction is an important tool in problem solving. One aspect of abstraction is information hiding. This is very useful in simulation where the real world is modelled, for example google maps. All details that are not essential are omitted to make it simpler. The London underground is an infamous example of this tool.

Automation is the building of models of real world objects and phenomenon in order to solve it computationally. Computer scientists have to decide relevant details and discard everything else. Algorithms and data structures can then be designed to solve the problem. In the example of modelling traffic flow, an example of a data structure would be a car with certain characteristics, an example of an algorithm would be the a description of how a car moves through a road.

Generalisation is a technique that allows for an abstracted solution to be applied to other problems, as any information making it unique to a specific problem has been removed.

# Procedural Abstraction:

Procedural abstraction is used to keep actually values involved in computations separate from overall design. This involves writing procedures, and passing parameters in order to perform computation. A car dealer, for example, may use a procedure for displaying a particular model of car, and pass parameters for the details of said car. Values are not returned to the main program when using procedural abstraction, a block of code is run based upon the variables parsed into it.

# Representational Abstraction:

Representational abstraction is what remains once all uncecessary information has been removed from a problem. The problem is fully represented for the needs of the program.
