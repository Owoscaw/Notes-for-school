Abstraction is an important tool in problem solving. One aspect of abstraction is information hiding. This is very useful in simulation where the real world is modelled, for example google maps. All details that are not essential are omitted to make it simpler. The London underground is an infamous example of this tool.

Automation is the building of models of real world objects and phenomenon in order to solve it computationally. Computer scientists have to decide relevant details and discard everything else. Algorithms and data structures can then be designed to solve the problem. In the example of modelling traffic flow, an example of a data structure would be a car with certain characteristics, an example of an algorithm would be the a description of how a car moves through a road.

Algorithms used to solve a problem are far removed from the machine code that actually executes the instructions. For example, IF x > Y: print(x) would be about 7 lines of 1s and 0s!!!


Procedural abstraction is used to keep actually values involved in computations separate from overall design. This involves writing procedures, and passing parameters in order to perform computation. A car dealer, for example, may use a procedure for displaying a particular model of car, and pass parameters for the details of said car. Values are not returned to the main program when using procedural abstraction, a block of code is ran based upon the variables parsed into it.

Functional abstraction is when a function is called to called in order to perform an operations and return a value. This does not require knowledge on how the function works.

Data abstraction is when the data or information relevant to a problem is in the form of an abstract data structure such as an array. A stack is an example of a data structure where items can only be added to or removed from the top. This could be implemented as an array with pointers to the top of the stack.
