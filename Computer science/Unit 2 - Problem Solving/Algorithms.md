A good algorithm has clear and precisely stated steps that produce a valid input for ANY input. Invalid inputs should be allowed and prompt a re-entry. It must terminate eventually and in as few steps as possible. Should be designed that people can easily understand and modify it.

Tools for algorithm design include hierarchy charts, pseudocode, and flowcharts. Different tools are applicable for different parts of designing an algorithm.

Sorting algorithms are a very common algorithm, there are many methods of sorting algorithms ranging from simple and slow to complex and fast. Some examples of sorting algorithms are the [[Bubble sort]] and the [[Quick sort]].
