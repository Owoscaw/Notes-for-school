The two most common searching algorithms are the binary and linear search. Linear search iterates through each item in a list until a match is found. Binary search uses the "divide and conquer" strategy to have the area needed to be searched every time, however only works on a sorted list. Binary search can often be implemented using a [[Trees]] data structure, specifically a binary tree.
