The purpose of testing software is to reveal areas, it is not to prove that the system works. A successful test is one that reveals areas. Testing can be classified as three aspects of testing:

- Module testing, testing each subroutine separately
- Program testing, testing each program in a system works 
- System testing, testing the entire system at once

Each type of testing escalates from the previous, a system contains many programs with many modules each.

A test plan defines how a test will commence and what data will be parsed. Data can include normal data, boundary data, and erroneous data. Normal data is just data that the program expects. Boundary data is data on the edge of a range of values that is expected. Erroneous data is data that is outside the range of expected values, including other variable types.

A test plan should be a table with column heads of test number, test data, purpose (boundary, erroneous), expected outcome, actual outcome.



Running code is the experimental approach to testing a program. Hand tracing is used to figure out how an algorithm works and why It will not work properly. A trace table is used to write down contents of variables, as well as conditions that may trigger a loop or branch.
