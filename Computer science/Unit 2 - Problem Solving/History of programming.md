In the 1960s, many programmers resisted the trend of programming languages becoming structured - they liked the "GO TO" functionality. This practice made programs hard to follow and even harder to debug. [[Computational thinking]] has evolved over time.

Structured programming is a method of writing a computer program that uses top-down down analysis for problem-solving (working from the top down), modularization for program structure, and structured code for individual modules. This makes programs easier to read and debug.

Divide and conquer is used to make modules (subroutines) that are used in the main program in order to provide structure to solving a problem. There can be many levels to this, creating modules within modules etcâ€¦ A hierarchy chart can be used to show this, where the lowest level (problem on top) executes first and sub problems execute left to right.

The benefits of this are that large programs can be broken down into subprograms and looked at individually. Modules can also be re-used multiple times. This also allows for many people to work on separate modules so that one problem can be solved faster.

Useful and meaningful names should be used for subroutines and variables. Each module should be self-contained in terms of variables and parameters, as well as performing a single task.
