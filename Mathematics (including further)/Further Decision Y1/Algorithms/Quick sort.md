Quick sort acomplishes the same task as [[Bubble sort]], using a different method. This method involves splitting the main list into sub lists. A pivot is selected in the centre of the list and items greater than it are placed in one sub list while the ones less than it are placed in another sub list. Pivots are then selected in each sub list and the process repeats.

Steps for quick sort:
\> Choose the midpoint item of the list as a pivot
\> Write down all items that are less than the pivot in a sub list, maintining their order
\> Write down the pivot
\> Write down the remaining items (greater than the pivot) in another sub list
\> Apply steps 1 through 4 to each sub list
\> When all items have been chosen as pivots,

This algorithm is often used in [[Optimisation algorithms]].
