A common task in processing data is to sort it into alphabetical or numerical order. The bubble sort can be performed on an unordered list to make the items in alphabetical or numerical order. A bubble sort can be carried out to make a list in ascending or descending order.

Steps for bubble sort:
\> Compare adjacent items
\> If they are in order, leave them
\> If they are not in order, swap them
\> Repeat until all adjacent items are not swapped in an iteration
